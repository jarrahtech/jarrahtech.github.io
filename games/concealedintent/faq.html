<p><b>Answers:</b></p>

<p><b><a name="turn_order">In what order do events occur during a
turn?</a></b></p>

<p>In the simulation engine, each ship’s plans are executed according to
the order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All launches for all ships</li>
  <li>All other non-move plans for all ships</li>
  <li>Planned moves for any remaining ships (those which have not
exploded) are split into 16 parts, and for each part:
    <ol>
      <li>Each ship makes their current 1/16th move</li>
      <li>All ships determine their detections levels</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Finally, any scenario events occur (e.g. escape pods appearing, etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>When displayed on the screen to the player, the sequence of events may
seem slightly out of order. This is because each action is given a
random start/end time (within bounds) to make the play phase appear more
interesting as all the ships will act at slightly different times
compared to each other.</p>

<p>This ordering has some implications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drone launches will occur even if the launching ship explodes, same
for shooting.</li>
  <li>Ships about to explode will not move.</li>
  <li>The level of detection a ship gains each turn does not depend on
their positions at the start of the turn, nor the end of the turn,
but instead is averaged over their positions throughout the turn.</li>
</ol>

<p><b><a name="extraction">How is it possible to complete the Extraction
mission?</a></b></p>

<p>The Extraction mission can be completed in two ways: an easy way and an
extremely hard way.</p>

<p>Here are some tips towards the easy way. Try to avoid fighting, you will
be quickly outnumbered. If you are not fighting, do you really need
drones or active sensors? Notice there is a large planet about half way
to the station. Remember if you hide behind something then you will
disappear to the enemy. Note that the informer will fly towards you, so
as long as you are close enough to the station, you don’t need to fly
towards them too. Also, using countermeasure will affect the enemy’s
detection the turn after they are used. So if you drop signature to 0 in
turn 4, then in turn 5 the enemies won’t see you (i.e., they can still
shoot you in turn 4).</p>

<p><b><a name="detection">How is detection determined?</a></b></p>

<p>The idea behind the detection system is that your detection builds over
time as you learn more about the enemy. But there is still the
possibility of it decreasing if they get far away or go low signature or
hide.</p>

<p>The formula for detection on an enemy ship each turn is:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">detection = (last_detection * decay) + current_sensor_gain + sharing</code></p>

<p>When calculating detection, first the level of detection the ship had on
a target the previous turn is reduced (“decayed”). The amount of
reduction changes depending on a number of factors, usually it is quite
low, just a few percent each turn, but if the target has effective 0
signature (due to countermeasures or no line-of-sight) then it can reach
400%, which means the target will completely disappear from sensors in a
quarter of a turn. This step allows detection levels to drop or for the
enemy to even disappear.</p>

<p>Then any detection you gain this turn from your sensors is added to the
remainder from the decay step. Here you can look at the sensitivity of
the sensors at the range of the target and then multiply that by the
target’s signature. The sensitivity can be seen by hovering over the
sensor’s component in the stats panel at the bottom centre of the
screen. For example, if there is an enemy ship with signature 20 at
range 2500km and you are using a passive Powered Omni sensor, then at
that range the sensitivity is 0.3. Thus you “gain” 20 * 0.3 = 6% that
turn, and hopefully your detection builds.</p>

<p>So first you lose a bit and then you gain a bit each turn. Hopefully
more of the latter, than the former.</p>

<p>This was done to get the desired effect with detection. It should slowly
build, unless the target is high signature. If you let a ship start to
get away, detection will slowly drop. If the target hides or goes very
low signature, then it may quickly disappear.</p>

<p>The detection calculation is done 16 times per turn as the ships move
and range changes and the result averaged - <a href="#turn_order">see
the answer to FAQ #1</a>.<br />
Also you also share detection among ships (but not perfectly) -
<a href="#sharing">see the answer to FAQ #4</a>.</p>

<p><b><a name="sharing">How do ships share detection?</a></b></p>

<p>After calculating detection for each pair of ships, each team shares
detection among all its ships. The idea is that these ships are in
communication with each other regarding the whereabouts of their
targets. All the ships in a team (all your ships comprise a single team)
compare the detection they have on every target. The ship with the
highest detection on a target then “shares” it with the others, but not
perfectly.</p>

<p>To get the best possible gain, the ships sharing detection must be
2000km apart; this is to model triangulation of the target. The further
the distance between ships from the 2000km mark, the less the gain (at
0km the gain is always 0, as it is at 4000km or further apart). In any
case the maximum detection gain a ship can get from sharing is 10% per
turn.</p>

<p>The ship with the highest detection on the target also gains a little
too, but this is normally a small effect of a couple of percent at most
and modified by the distance between ships (again a separation of 2000km
provides the best gain).</p>

<p>This sharing process means that the quickest way to increase detection
on a target is to launch multiple drones and keep them all around 2000km
from each other. Although when doing this remember there is a +1
signature per drone controlled (caused by the communication), or higher
if Linkers are loaded.</p>

<p><b><a name="usurp">How does usurping/jamming work?</a></b></p>

<p>There are two weapons in the game that can change the controller of a
drone: the Usurper and Jammer. Hitting a target with the Jammer gives a
70% base chance of turning it uncontrolled neutral. Hitting a target
with the Usurper gives a base 40% chance of having a drone convert to
being under your control, and if that doesn’t work, a 20% base chance of
turning it uncontrolled neutral. But how do those base chances convert
to actual probabilities in practice?</p>

<p># If the target is not a drone or mine, then the actual probability
will be 0%.<br />
# If the target is autonomous (as per the skirmish modifier), then the
actual probability is the same as the base.<br />
# If the target is uncontrolled and neutral (if for instance it was
previously jammed), then the actual probability is 100%.<br />
# Otherwise, the base is multiplied by the distance from target to its
controller divided by 3000km and divided again by 1+ the number of
Linkers loaded on the target’s controller. This means that the chance of
converting the target is greater the further a drone is from its
controller, and smaller when the target’s controller has Linkers.</p>

<p><b><a name="notification">How do I get Steam notifications to
work?</a></b></p>

<p>Concealed Intent can now send Steam notifications for online games. When
you have been challenged or when the game is waiting for you to enter
plans, it can put a small popup window on your desktop (if the Steam
client is running). You may be asked to decide if you wish to allow
these notifications the next time you play Concealed Intent or start an
online duel. Alternatively, you can check or change these settings and
notifications for all your games (which enable the feature) at:
