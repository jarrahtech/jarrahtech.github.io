Current Version: 1.1.0 (13th March 2023)

Known Issues:
* Some builds have scenarios end abruptly (without final explosion) - hard to replicate, may be fixed with 1.1 (not seen since)
* Possible, but unlikely, that Good AI may not find a positive EV plan within the timelimit, even if one exists - what to do?

Immediate Roadmap:
* Bugfixes
* Look into Steam support?

1.1.0 (13th March 2023)
* Add Online support (if no connection do nothing and continue)
  - Add feedback page
  - Add JarrahTech news box
  - Collect anonymous stats on player progress and locale
* AI 
  - if shooting does not destroy anything, then try the next base's shooting rather than check if a drop is possible (as no new spaces will have appeared)
  - time limit stored in config file (timeout_seconds), defaults to 15 seconds - use  the best plan found so far if time expires
  - try (a little) not to put bases that will be immediately destroyed right next to the players home
* Change Tutorial text and ensure colours and controls referred to are correct when displayed
* Code signed the executable (with a self-created certificate)
* Make tutorial skippable and add a link to a YouTube video of the tutorial
* Dropped bombs make a small explosion even if they don't destroy what they are on
* Set explosions to be at the top of the render queue so they are not hidden by planets/bases
* Fix tooltip for unclaimed powerup hexes
* Stop unlocks running over menu if there are lots of them on game over screen
* Give different enemy types different names

1.0.0 (9th December 2022) 
* Initial Release to Itch.io
