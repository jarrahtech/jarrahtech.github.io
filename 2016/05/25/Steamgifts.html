</h2>
      <p>As my indie game nears a full release, my interest in indie marketing
increases. Recently I was on the <a href="https://www.spacegamejunkie.com/">Space Game
Junkie</a> podcast, and one of the hosts
mentioned that the <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com">Steamgifts</a> website had
not worked well for their sales effort. At that point I was planning on
including the site for marketing Concealed Intent’s full release. There
are a number of game giveaways on Steamgifts with messages stating they
are for marketing purposes, and a few people have contacted me asking
for keys to giveaway on the website (all refused, I can do it myself).
So I wondered, how useful is Steamgifts as a marketing channel? Not
finding any information online, I decided to try a few amateur
experiments just to see how it worked.</p>

<p>For those that don’t know, Steamgifts is a website where members can
give away copies of Steam (and only Steam) games. There are hundreds of
games given away each day. It is not designed as a site for game
marketing, but giveaway creators can include a short message, and these
are often explicitly advertising related (for a game, or group, or
YouTube channel, etc). The winner is chosen at random among those
members of the site who have chosen to enter. Members are restricted in
the number of giveaways they can enter, and must have at least $100
worth of games on their Steam account (so it is hard to enter a giveaway
multiple times). There are currently a <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/XaCbA/list-of-all-cv-levels-and-their-corresponding-real-cv">little over 900,000
members</a>,
of which around 135,000 have given away at least one game, and some many
more. If a giveaways is open to everyone for over a day it will usually
have 1000-2000 entries, depending on the game. Some very large giveaways
(50+ copies) or desirable games gather 10,000+ entries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/LttHx/concealed-intent">Here is an example of a
giveaway</a>
created for this experiment. The marketing text in the message is the
standard copy for my Steam Early Access game, Concealed Intent. A brief
description of the game, followed by a link and call-to-action, “please
wishlist the game” (I thought a “please buy” CTA might be overly
ambitious), then some social media links. The only way to enter the
competition is through this webpage. So theoretically everyone who
enters the giveaway should be exposed to the message.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/steamgifts_impressions.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do very little marketing for the game at the moment, because as a sole
developer I chose to spend most of my time on development tasks. This
will shift in the next few weeks as full release nears and I go nearly
full-time on marketing. However, during the experiment, I did no other
marketing so views on the Steam store page are at a low and baseline
level. Above is a graph of the store page impressions according to
Steam, the grey line is total visits. Can you see the giveaways’ effect?
There are 8 giveaways through this period, each separated by at least a
day. The two most successful giveaways ended on the 11th May &amp; 17th May.
On those days there is a noticeable jump in direct visits to the store
page (the light blue line).</p>

<p>Let’s see the raw numbers for Concealed Intent giveaways. I made two
giveaways, each for a few days, a week apart. Both giveaways spanned the
same days of the week. The number of visitors from Steamgifts to the
Steam store page is measured through Google Analytics (which I suspect
under counts visits slightly), and the number of extra wishlist entries
is taken from Steam after subtracting the baseline growth in the week
before I started the giveaways (1.5 per day).</p>

    <tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">890</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">6</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">70</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">11</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>7.9%</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>1.2%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">1027</td>

      <td style="text-align: center">47</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">8</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>4.6%</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>0.8%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I believe this CTR compares very favourably with other advertising.
However, it must be considered that the cost of each giveaway is a copy
of Concealed Intent, with a retail price of US$15, making those clicks
extremely expensive by traditional measures. Although, that is only the
case if the winner was going to buy the game at full price (or at all),
probably unlikely given current indie game sales. Both winners did
immediately redeem the game and play, which makes me happy. There were
no extra sales in during the giveaway period, but I did gain a couple of
Twitter followers (of course I can’t be sure they came from Steamgifts).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that rise in the number of entries for the
second giveaway corresponds with a drop in CTR. Perhaps the second
giveaway included many people already aware of the game from the first
giveaway. In any case, there may be diminishing returns on repeated
giveaways. Thus they didn’t need to pay much attention to the text or
visit the store a second time. I suspect a third giveaway would be even
lower.</p>

<p>Prior to giving away my own game, I also tried giving different games
for which I had keys leftover from bundle purchases, all with the same
Concealed Intent marketing message attached. The *’ed rows indicate
multiple overlapping giveaways with aggregated statistics.</p>

<p>Here the CTR is much lower. So low in fact I think that errors in
counting visits or random changes in non-Steamgifts wishlisting will
greatly skew the figures. Basically, giving away other people’s bundled
game does not have much effect (although of course using bundled games
means there is not much expense either). I would suggest relatively few
people read the message, and most of the clicks are from checking out
the game actually being given away before entering (rather than for the
game in the marketing copy - makes sense to me).</p>

<p>So giving away my game on Steamgifts netted me at least 117 views of my
Steam Store page and onto 19 extra wishlists for a cost between 0 -
US$30. Other marketing opportunities available to indiedevs are:
self-promotion on social media; asking web magazines and YouTubers for
coverage; or paying hard cash for advertising. Given this, I would
consider using Steamgifts giveaways again - just to increase awareness
of the game. Although in small numbers (1 at a time), spaced with larger
time gaps between them (at least a week), and only until awareness of
the game reaches some as yet undefined level.</p>

<p>It is left as an exercise for a reader to measure the marketing
effectiveness of giving away 50+ copies at once. I am not brave enough
to try it with my game (at least not yet).</p>

<p>I am very interested to hear other people’s experiences or comments.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I linked this post in the Steamgifts forum and an
interesting discussion ensued over the value of 50+ giveaways or
restricting entry to more engaged members. <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/oC2fe/steamgifts-for-marketing">Here it
is</a>,
worth a read if you found this interesting.</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-07-09</em> - Hi Anton, I agree that using the full retail value of the game is not completely valid, although I disagree there is no cost at all. There is an opportunity cost, but it will be much smaller than the retail, as it would only be the case if the person winning the game would buy the game anyway. So the cost per giveaway will be somewhere between 0 &amp; US$15. I just don’t know where. the full retail is a handy maximum. Other numbers would be US$11.04 (the average amount paid including discounts and foreign currencies), US$10 (the last sale price), about US$6 (what I get per average copy after Steam &amp; tax). The likelihood (so far) of someone buying after going to the game’s store page is around 1 in 10000 (and about 1 in 1000 for wishlisting, so hopefully the sales will improve after full release). On that basis the value per view is less than a cent! Now I’ve worked that all out, it is a bit depressing. I just had another check of the Steam backend and I can’t find the number of follows the game has. Sales, wishlists and views are all very clear, but I can’t see follows. Doesn’t mean they are not there somewhere, I’ll keep looking. Sounds like you have some nice friends :)</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-07-11</em> - It is a grey area :) Steam rules say I can’t give out the financials. I think I’m probably safe given that. To work out Steam’s cut from the above you would need to know my tax rate, refund rate and chargeback rate, plus the exact amount. So it is not obvious. Then again details of Steam’s cut is not hard to find - Cliffski (much bigger dev than me) put it on his blog just this weekend (<a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/07/09/why-valve-should-give-jobs-to-journalists/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/07/09/why-valve-should-give-jobs-to-journalists/">http://positech.co.uk/cliff…</a> ) and Garry Newman put up his sales &amp; refund rates (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276450/Rust_Garrys_Mod_dev_shares_data_on_refund_rates.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276450/Rust_Garrys_Mod_dev_shares_data_on_refund_rates.php">http://www.gamasutra.com/vi…</a> ). So if that is ok, I think my vague numbers are ok :)</p>
