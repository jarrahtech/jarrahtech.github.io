      <p>It takes more than one game to become a successful game studio. A
portfolio of games is required to spread risk. This is even more the
case for Jarrah Technology, as on current trends Concealed Intent will
not be a financial success. I am committed to a 1.1 update and have
started work towards that goal. However, realistically any time spent
will not reap a corresponding financial reward. Thus with the little
time remaining to me for working on games full-time, I need to come up
with new games quickly. Luckily, ideas are not the problem. There are
exceptionally few “ideas people” in games, because everyone has tons of
ideas. Choosing which potential games deserve the risk of developing
with limited resources is the real skill.</p>

<p>Over the last four years I’ve compiled a list of three dozen “maybe
later” game ideas. They are of variable quality, but there is no
standout, clearly a winner, concept. So how to choose? After Concealed
Intent I have a few requirements for my next game. First, it must be
simple. Simple to develop and simple to play. With only a few months
left available for unrestricted development, any game I start must be
finished within 9 months or risk never being finished. Realistically,
with Concealed Intent work and other distractions, 6 months is the
maximum time. Thus since I also repeatedly underestimate effort
significantly, I want games that I think I can create in about 3 months.
So an order of magnitude smaller than Concealed Intent. This has many
implications. For a start, no story, that takes too long (or at least,
it takes me too long). Also, my next game will be 2D or 3D with a fixed
camera. Having a fully mobile camera in a 3D world adds a host of UI and
control problems. The next game needs to be relatively cheap to make
(not including my time). Being able to reuse existing assets is best,
otherwise I need to be aware of how much extra cost is required and
factor that into to likely earnings. It is a fuzzy line.</p>

<p>The game should be simple to play. Definitely no complex internal
simulation models. It should be clear what is happening on the screen
and quick to learn. This is for two reasons: it is easier to develop;
and, it widens the market of the game. Concealed Intent is complex to
play, and difficult to learn. There is a lot of maths happening “under
the hood”. This greatly decreases the number of people willing to play.
The vast majority of potential players (and press) will only play the
game for a few minutes. If after that time they are still going through
a tutorial explaining mathematical game concepts, most will stop and
never start again. Thus, my next game will just have a couple of simple
game mechanics.</p>

<p>So those are the criteria for evaluating ideas: quick, simple, cheap
(and fun!). With that in mind my long list became a short list of 4. So
I decided to prototype them. Two on paper as the technical complexity is
low, so the gameplay elements are most important. Two in code as the
most challenging part would be the programming. At this stage I don’t
want to talk too much about what each idea actually involves - it is too
soon. Instead, here are photos of each game in progress.</p>
