</h2>
      <p>September is over and the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/374150/announcements/detail/582476975922474209">scheduled month of dev work for Concealed
Intent 1.1
complete</a>.
The amount achieved was about as much as expected, although not as much
as hoped. Since the last update Steam turn notifications are working,
but it was a little harder than anticipated. Then came a new skirmish
objective (Gather) and a bunch of bug fixes (mainly for Linux).
Unfortunately that means there was not time for extra work on campaign
missions or online. Still, the update is a large body of work and I’m
glad to get it done, the game will be better for it. Now I just need to
test it extensively before release! The plan is to give myself a
fortnight of testing, so look for the update in mid-October (barring
major issues).</p>

<p>Looking at my Concealed Intent todo list I am amazed by how short it is - the shortest it has been since starting! It contains probably about a
fortnight of online server improvements (not visible to players) and
another fortnight of campaign/skirmish/cosmetic improvements. There are
also a half-dozen “nice-to-haves”. Given this list, I am inclined to do
a month’s work for a 1.2 update. However, it will not be until next year - hopefully earlier rather than later. After Concealed Intent 1.1 is
released I will start work on a much smaller space-themed game codenamed
“Blockade Runner” (because I haven’t thought of anything better yet).</p>

<p>Here are the final notes on the original (and intentionally overly
ambitious) update plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements - the main things here are an automated
build system and better feedback management. Both are complete.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements - most of these were done as part
of 1.0.1. A few more have been done - most notably an onscreen shielding
effect and a plan breakdown on the player focus buttons.</li>
  <li>Linux support - There is now a Linux build for internal testing, so
far it has performed just like the PC/Mac version.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes - many bugfixes completed and the issue list is empty
again.</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications - Working, but needs more testing.</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions - a little balance work has been
done, but there are no new campaign missions.</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns - done, the new Gather objective has the player rushing</li>
  <li>Online improvements - nothing significant for players done here.</li>
</ul>
