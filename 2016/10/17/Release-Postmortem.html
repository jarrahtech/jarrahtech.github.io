      <p>After way too long in development <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed
Intent</a> was fully released on
the 2nd August following 9 months in Steam’s Early Access program. This
post details some useful stats I collected between starting EA, through
to the end of September. The kind of information I would have found
interesting, at least for comparison purposes. Hope someone else finds
it useful.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent is a simultaneous turn-based game of 3D tactical space
combat. It is probably a niche game (turn-based tactics), with a crowded
theme (space games seem very common right now). It was created by a solo
dev (with some outsourced 2D art), and thus it was hard to manage both
development and marketing. Mainly the marketing suffered, especially
considering my inexperience. Raising awareness of Concealed Intent and
the release campaign could have been managed much better - I will know
for next time! For my lessons learnt see <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/CharlesCordingley/20160802/278357/Concealed_Intent_Development_Postmortem.php">this Gamasutra
post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sales</strong></p>

<p>On to the stuff everyone really wants to see - how many copies were
sold. Unfortunately, I am not prepared to provide the actual numbers -
I’ve signed agreements not to give specifics. However, the sales are
better than some of the stories seen on this site, but well below most
similar post-mortems (it is in the 3 digit range). More importantly was
the game profitable?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/basic_revenue.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here are the sales of Concealed Intent over the last 11 months compared
to the direct costs of making the game. This cost figure includes a
license for the Unity Engine, the cost of some outsourced 2D art (from
the developing world - where I live), and a few other things. These
revenue numbers are after any returns/refunds and the store’s cut. It is
also notable here that the sales in the month of release were more than
double the entire 9 months of Early Access. Also, interestedly, sales
from Steam are about an order of magnitude greater than non-Steam
sources (something to consider when planning promotional effort).</p>

<p>So I made the development costs back with the release, great right? Not
quite.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/cpd_revenue.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here is the same graph with the indirect and living costs of development
added. The indirect costs include company fees (accounting etc), but
mostly a perhaps ill-advised and premature <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/CharlesCordingley/20150312/238595/Impressions_of_a_GDC_firsttimer.php">trip to
GDC</a>.
I think it likely that the game’s revenue will eventually recoup these
costs. However, living costs are another matter. The basic expense of
surviving for 4 years (and I live very cheaply) while creating Concealed
Intent will probably never be recovered. I do not expect to ever pay
myself anything from Concealed Intent earnings. The biggest piece of
advice I can give is to greatly limit the scope of your games as time is
a huge expense!</p>

<p><strong>Returns, Wishlists &amp; Coupons</strong></p>

<p>During Early Access the return/refund rate on Concealed Intent was just
under 6. I thought this was fair, especially since a couple of the
refunds corresponded with the time a bad bug slipped into a release.
Now, two months after the release, the equivalent rate is under 5. The
rate of returns dropped significantly with release.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent is on 10x as many Steam wishlists compared to copies
sold. So far around 5% of people who wishlist the game go on to purchase
it. On that basis, if the conversion rate continues, I expect the sell
many more copies in the future, probably during sales discounts. I think
this is a great system. Much of my pre-release marketing efforts
suggested wishlisting the game. The measurements I could manage, suggest
people are orders of magnitude more likely to wishlist than purchase -
and being on a wishlist means they are easier to reach later.</p>

<p>A Steam coupon program for Concealed Intent started a few weeks before
release. The discount is always equal to or slightly greater than the
largest discount available in sales. So far the redemption rate has been
in the very low single digits. I haven’t found it particularly useful.</p>

<p><strong>Promotional Keys</strong></p>

<p>Between the start of Early Access and Release around 200 promotional
keys of Concealed Intent were sent out. This is probably a relatively
low number, and I would consider sending more in future, especially
considering the response rate. Some of these went to friends or people
who had supported the game, but the vast majority were for marketing
purposes. Of the keys sent, only 90 were redeemed. I have been checking
reseller sites, but to my knowledge the game has never appeared there. I
assume the majority of keys sent are sitting unused in people inboxes.
This is not overly surprising. Most of the keys were sent unbidden, the
email equivalent of a cold call. It should be expected that most will be
ignored.</p>

<p>Of the keys sent to YouTuber’s, 23% resulted in a video. All that I
could understand (some were in foreign languages) were at least mildly
positive. The publication of a couple of these videos corresponded with
a noticeable day-on-day increase in sales/wishlists.</p>

<p>Keys to websites resulted in a review 15% of the time, but a third (5)
of those were negative. Also 5 of website contacts resulted in requests
for money (and no review because I never responded). I sent keys to most
of the big websites, none of whom covered the game, but most of the keys
were to small sites. None of the coverage seemed to make a difference to
sales/wishlists.</p>

<p>Based on this, in future I will put more effort getting promotional keys
to YouTubers and streamers. This seems to clearly be the way to go for
small indie games. Sending keys to the big websites, involves little
cost with a big (if low probability) reward, so that will continue. It
is hard to justify the effort for small websites - I’m not sure about
continuing with that.</p>

<p>There were also a few giveaways organised during the release week. I
measured the success of these by the number of visits to the Steam store
page using Google Analytics. I suspect these figures underestimate the
number of visits, but should give a basic ranking of the sites. A Reddit
AMA &amp; giveaway on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/4vvrpa/my_game_was_released_today_on_steam_after_years/">/r/pcgaming</a>
resulted in 135 visits per copy given away. A set of giveaways on
<a href="http://www.steamgifts.com">Steamgifts</a> resulted in 40 visits per copy,
and a small giveaway on a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/turn.based.tactical.games">relevant Facebook
group</a>
resulted in 10 visits per copy.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>

<p>The next question is how valuable is a visit? Using the number of
impressions (seeing a Steam ad) and visits (to the Steam store page) as
provided by internal Steam analytics, plus the average amount received
per sale and taking into account wishlisting by adding 50% to that
amount (1 sale = 10 wishlists at 5% conversion), the following values
are calculated for various periods. CPM is cost per 1000, CPC is cost
per click.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Early Access
    <ul>
      <li>CPM US$0.85 for impressions</li>
      <li>CPC US$0.02 for visits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Release week (35% off)
    <ul>
      <li>CPM US$1.06 for impressions</li>
      <li>CPC US$0.05 for visits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Since release week
    <ul>
      <li>CPM US$0.63 for impressions</li>
      <li>CPC US$0.02 for visits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Remember these values are for the Steam site/client itself, probably the
most well targeted and best possible audience for Steam games. The
equivalent values for other places will be less as the audience becomes
less likely to purchase a Steam game. Of course, it is also not possible
to pay for advertising on the Steam store, so these values are just what
it would be worth if you could.</p>

<p>Thus, I would guess that given my understanding of advertising rates, it
is unlikely I could advertise profitably except perhaps for cheap
impressions when discounting (but presumably not during big sales due
the large amount of competition).</p>
