      <p><a href="/2016/05/25/Steamgifts">Previously</a> I have written about my experience
running giveaways on <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com">Steamgifts.com</a> for
marketing Concealed Intent. Several people made some good suggestions as
to what I could do better, or at least differently. One of those was
asking other people for their experiences.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So I created a survey and asked other people giving away games on
Steamgifts about their experiences (you can see the survey
<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/WiKcTY54fEJU0hah1">here</a>). As I’m not a marketing
or survey professional, I doubt it is a particularly good survey, but it
is a start. It is focused on being fast to fill in, with questions
looking at who is making these giveaways, why, and whether they are
successful. Now a couple of weeks later, it is time to look at the
responses. For those who wish to do their own analysis, the CSV of the
raw responses (after a small edit to ensure anonymity) is available
<a href="/assets/posts/steamgifts/steamgifts_survey_20160727.csv">here</a>.</p>

<p>There were 27 responses, 5 of which I discounted: one because it seemed
like a joke, and 4 others because marketing was not listed as either the
primary or secondary reason for the giveaway. In the rest of this post,
the remaining 22 responses are the only ones used in the analysis below.
This is quite a small sample size, and thus the results should probably
be considered as anecdotal evidence for any position.</p>

<p>Also, two of the survey’s questions may not have worked particularly
well. There seems to be a surprisingly large number of responses that
the giveaway was to increase sales, but was organised by people
unconnected with the dev team. This is not what I expected, and in
retrospect it may be a poorly worded question. To me, if someone
receives free keys directly from the dev team (as I have been asked to
do numerous times), then that person is acting on behalf of the dev
team. Although, looking at the question again, maybe that is not clear,
or maybe people are just acquiring keys and then promoting the game on
their own. This survey can’t tell the difference. Also the free text
question on how results were measured is hard to categorise. Basically
all the serious responses suggest mainly looking at stats on the steam
backend, although a couple mentioned google analytics.</p>

<p>First, who answered the survey? Responders represented a broad spread of
giveaway sizes and experience. Most of the games had not yet been
bundled, and most had been out on Steam for a little while (not EA or
just released).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/demographics.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Does Steamgifts for marketing work? Well, the response is decidedly
mixed. Note that success here is self-reported using what ever metric
the responder wishes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/all_success.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So no clear answer on whether giveaways are useful for marketing here.
Is there some other factor that explains giveaway success in this data?
It seems that people self-reporting giveaway success are less likely to
measure that success (so how do they know?), more likely to make small
giveaways, and more likely to make multiple giveaways (seems obvious).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/measured_breakdown.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/size_breakdown.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Being part of the dev team, the goal of the marketing, and the state of
the game either did not seem to matter, or made only a small difference
to success compared to unsuccessful giveaways.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/team_breakdown.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking at it from a different angle, measuring the results of a
giveaway didn’t seem to make much difference to whether it was
considered a success. While interestingly, larger giveaways were
reported as unsuccessful more often.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/success_factors.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So what is the conclusion? Need more data is probably the prudent
answer. However, I’m going to properly sit on the fence and say that
Steamgifts giveaways may help marketing, but there is no clear path to
success to be found here. In particular, despite the extra visibility
they create, larger giveaways are not necessarily better. Also, I do
find it somewhat concerning that so many people reported not measuring
their results - how else do they know if it worked?</p>
