      <p>It has been a little while since my last update, so I thought I should
let people know what is happening with Concealed Intent. Previously I
wrote about creating some prototypes and having time off. Both those
achievements have been unlocked! If you would like to see my thoughts on
prototypes, <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">look here</a>. After that I
said there would be a month’s work on a 1.1 release, trying to get as
far down this list as possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements to the client and server code</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements, as suggested through player
feedback</li>
  <li>Linux support</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns</li>
  <li>Online improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>Work began on this list at the start of September. Thus I will stop
developing and start testing at the end of this month. Assuming no big
issues are found, I’m still on track for an October release.</p>

<p>So how am I progressing with the list? Firstly, there were a couple of
things not considered. On the positive side, there was a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/374150/announcements/detail/595985181035046794">1.0.1
release</a>
that contained many of the <em>Cosmetic and control improvements</em>, so much
of that task was done before I began. On the downside, my hard drive
crashed the day I planned to start work, costing me a couple of days
productivity (keep your backups up to date!). Also, I forgot to add
bugfixes into that todo list. Thanks to more testing and the good work
of a couple of players (obliviondoll and FridayBiology were particularly
helpful) a few extra bugs were discovered and have (or will be) fixed as
a priority.</p>

<p>So how is that list actually looking as of today?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements - the main things here are an automated
build system and better feedback management. Both are complete, and
while players will notice little difference, both should save me loads
of time to work on other tasks. There are lots of other backend tasks
that need to be done, but I will probably leave them until later.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements - most of these were done as part
of 1.0.1. A few more have been done (most notably an onscreen shielding
effect). There is one item outstanding, but I haven’t scoped it yet -
I’ll try to work out if it is possible in the coming week.</li>
  <li>Linux support - There is now a Linux build for internal testing, so
far it has performed just like the PC/Mac version with the exception of
a few cosmetic issues. This task is looking good. Strangely, my Linux
version has issues with anti-aliasing which has meant the height-markers
for all versions have needed to change.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes - there are now four minor bugs outstanding I’ll be starting
work on over the next week. A few other minor bug fixes will be in the
next release, plus a major online game fix that has already been
released. Please let me know if you see anything “weird” or “wrong”.</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications - Just started work on this and the
documentation is making a great deal more sense than the last time I
looked. Confident I can get it done.</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions - a little balance work has been
done (coolers will be nerfed in 1.1) and I have ideas for more things
here, but am currently uncertain if I should do an extra couple of
missions or a new skirmish type first - I might only have time for one
(but will of course try for both).</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns - see above, if you have any ideas let me know.</li>
  <li>Online improvements - probably will not make it far enough to do
anything here, but if I do it will be something small</li>
</ul>

<p>There it is. I would say progress so far is better than expected
(especially considering the hard drive crash), but who knows how things
will go for the remainder of the month. In any case, be assured I am
working hard trying to improve the game!</p>
