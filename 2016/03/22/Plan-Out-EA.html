</h2>
      <p>Looking at the Concealed Intent plan for Early Access, all the work
originally promised (plus a bit more) is complete. Now is the time to
work out when to fully release the game.</p>

<p>One thing that has become clear during Early Access is that if a solo
game developer tries to do development and marketing at the same time,
then both are done poorly. So the current plan is to at some point to
declare Concealed Intent ready for release. Then wait between a
fortnight and a month, just testing and checking there are no bugs or
spelling mistakes (also preparing marketing materials). Then spend a
month on just marketing before the actual release. During this two month
period no new features will be added to the game, only the smallest
changes will be considered and then only if necessary.</p>

<p>The other thing to consider when planning a release date is the Steam
Summer Sale. I don’t know when it will be this year (yet), but the last
two years it has been a fortnight in June. When that event is running
any game launch will be swamped and disappear in the hype. Concealed
Intent’s two week launch window must not overlap with that sale.</p>

<p>Combine all that and if Concealed Intent is to launch before the Steam
Summer Sale then I need to stop right now and start the bug checking
phase. I don’t want to do that. I planned to complete a couple of
iterations on the campaign work, but I have only completed one so far.
Unfortunately I have been sick (probably the flu) and this has cost me
nearly a fortnight’s worth of work. Work I still want to complete. So in
the end the decision is easy (thanks to being ill), Concealed Intent
will be released after the Steam Summer Sale.</p>

<p>So what does that mean? Assuming that the sale is in June, I will
consider that the bug check month, and July the marketing month. Thus
the aim is to release Concealed Intent in early August. If the sale is
in July, then I may push the release back a little. Fingers crossed it
is June (and no other problems/issues arise).</p>

<p>On that basis I have until the end of May to continue working on
Concealed Intent features. Although I’m not going to be working
full-time on the game. Firstly, I’m about to go on a holiday, as my
girlfriend has taken to the expanded timeline and corresponding decrease
in pressure to declare its time for a break. I agree with her, there is
no risk of losing dev momentum at the moment as being sick has sent me
back to zero in that regard anyway. After the break I also need to start
thinking about what to do after Concealed Intent. So to that end I will
taking a week or two out of the plan to create prototypes when possible.
That should still leave enough time for two or three Concealed Intent
releases. My task list will be:</p>

<p>Ongoing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bugfixes</li>
  <li>Campaign improvements</li>
  <li>Improvements to Skirmish “Hard AI”</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible New Work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handle multiple monitors (this is difficult as I only have a single
monitor, but it will likely require updating the libraries used by the
game and that part can be done in preparation for a proper fix. The
update may also help with other reported issues.)</li>
  <li>Neutral system in skirmishes (like in online games, unknown ships are
displayed as neutrals until identified - this will probably be a
modifier)</li>
  <li>Extra objective scenarios in Skirmishes</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlikely Features (maybe for after release):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linux version</li>
  <li>Non-Steam non-DRM version</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s the plan. Hopefully I can stick to this one (all the others
turned out to be overly optimistic). So I’ll be back soon and initially
working on another pass of the campaign. Comments welcome!!</p>
