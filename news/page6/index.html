        <p><p>It has been a while, so perhaps time for an update on what is happening
and what is planned for the near future.</p>

<p>Right now I am working through ideas and mechanics for Project Blockade
Runner. That is not its real name, but I haven’t thought of anything
better yet. It is still at a very early stage, and the basic concept is
still mutating (the blockade part is decreasing in prominence), so I
don’t want to share screenshots yet. Although for people who regularly
read this blog, it was one of the paper prototypes from <a href="/2016/08/30/Prototyping">this
post</a>, shown again below. This one seemed the
most interesting to me. Also, I think the basic game mechanic can be
reused as an engine in a couple of different games. So this one scored
best on interest, ease and business. You can be confident there will be
more info about this game in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/prototypes/blockade_full.png"><img src="/assets/posts/prototypes/blockade.png" alt="Blockade Runner prototype" title="Blockade Runner prototype" /></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the game seems to be more Blocked Runner at the moment.
My personal log says I have managed just 17 hours work on the project so
far - and it shows. What has been happening instead over the last five
weeks since the Concealed Intent 1.1 update? Well, I went away for a
week to recharge. Very nice break it was too. Many admin tasks that were
“left for later” as Concealed Intent headed towards release back in
August are now completed. According to my log that has taken 42 hours of
effort in recent weeks. There was quite a backlog, but they are all done
now. I have also been playing games. Of course this is work, really it
is! I have put some videos up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">my personal YouTube
channel</a> and
associated <a href="www.agamedevplays.com">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Also there has been a dribble of work on Concealed Intent. Two small bug
fix updates have been released. If there are more bugs discovered I will
fix them ASAP. Otherwise, I will be taking a break from the game until
the new year. At this stage I’m fairly determined to make at least a 1.2
release before the middle of 2017. After that it will depend on sales
and time. I have started compiling a list of “must-have” items for a 1.2
version. Currently there are 8 items on it comprising about a week’s
work. That means there is another fortnight or “nice-to-have” items that
I could do, plus maybe another week of experimental/exploratory items.
That would make for a decent solid release. I have a good list of
possibles improvements. Anyone who contacts me with a suggestion also
gets it added to the list for consideration.</p>

<p>I had better get back to work!</p>

        <p><p>After way too long in development <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed
Intent</a> was fully released on
the 2nd August following 9 months in Steam’s Early Access program. This
post details some useful stats I collected between starting EA, through
to the end of September. The kind of information I would have found
interesting, at least for comparison purposes. Hope someone else finds
it useful.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent is a simultaneous turn-based game of 3D tactical space
combat. It is probably a niche game (turn-based tactics), with a crowded
theme (space games seem very common right now). It was created by a solo
dev (with some outsourced 2D art), and thus it was hard to manage both
development and marketing. Mainly the marketing suffered, especially
considering my inexperience. Raising awareness of Concealed Intent and
the release campaign could have been managed much better - I will know
for next time! For my lessons learnt see <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/CharlesCordingley/20160802/278357/Concealed_Intent_Development_Postmortem.php">this Gamasutra

        <p><p>September is over and the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/374150/announcements/detail/582476975922474209">scheduled month of dev work for Concealed
Intent 1.1
complete</a>.
The amount achieved was about as much as expected, although not as much
as hoped. Since the last update Steam turn notifications are working,
but it was a little harder than anticipated. Then came a new skirmish
objective (Gather) and a bunch of bug fixes (mainly for Linux).
Unfortunately that means there was not time for extra work on campaign
missions or online. Still, the update is a large body of work and I’m
glad to get it done, the game will be better for it. Now I just need to
test it extensively before release! The plan is to give myself a
fortnight of testing, so look for the update in mid-October (barring
major issues).</p>

<p>Looking at my Concealed Intent todo list I am amazed by how short it is - the shortest it has been since starting! It contains probably about a
fortnight of online server improvements (not visible to players) and
another fortnight of campaign/skirmish/cosmetic improvements. There are
also a half-dozen “nice-to-haves”. Given this list, I am inclined to do
a month’s work for a 1.2 update. However, it will not be until next year - hopefully earlier rather than later. After Concealed Intent 1.1 is
released I will start work on a much smaller space-themed game codenamed
“Blockade Runner” (because I haven’t thought of anything better yet).</p>

<p>Here are the final notes on the original (and intentionally overly
ambitious) update plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements - the main things here are an automated
build system and better feedback management. Both are complete.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements - most of these were done as part
of 1.0.1. A few more have been done - most notably an onscreen shielding
effect and a plan breakdown on the player focus buttons.</li>
  <li>Linux support - There is now a Linux build for internal testing, so
far it has performed just like the PC/Mac version.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes - many bugfixes completed and the issue list is empty
again.</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications - Working, but needs more testing.</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions - a little balance work has been
done, but there are no new campaign missions.</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns - done, the new Gather objective has the player rushing</li>
  <li>Online improvements - nothing significant for players done here.</li>
</ul>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It has been a little while since my last update, so I thought I should
let people know what is happening with Concealed Intent. Previously I
wrote about creating some prototypes and having time off. Both those
achievements have been unlocked! If you would like to see my thoughts on
prototypes, <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">look here</a>. After that I
said there would be a month’s work on a 1.1 release, trying to get as
far down this list as possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements to the client and server code</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements, as suggested through player
feedback</li>
  <li>Linux support</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns</li>
  <li>Online improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>Work began on this list at the start of September. Thus I will stop
developing and start testing at the end of this month. Assuming no big
issues are found, I’m still on track for an October release.</p>

<p>So how am I progressing with the list? Firstly, there were a couple of
things not considered. On the positive side, there was a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/374150/announcements/detail/595985181035046794">1.0.1
release</a>
that contained many of the <em>Cosmetic and control improvements</em>, so much
of that task was done before I began. On the downside, my hard drive
crashed the day I planned to start work, costing me a couple of days
productivity (keep your backups up to date!). Also, I forgot to add
bugfixes into that todo list. Thanks to more testing and the good work
of a couple of players (obliviondoll and FridayBiology were particularly
helpful) a few extra bugs were discovered and have (or will be) fixed as
a priority.</p>

<p>So how is that list actually looking as of today?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements - the main things here are an automated
build system and better feedback management. Both are complete, and
while players will notice little difference, both should save me loads
of time to work on other tasks. There are lots of other backend tasks
that need to be done, but I will probably leave them until later.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements - most of these were done as part
of 1.0.1. A few more have been done (most notably an onscreen shielding
effect). There is one item outstanding, but I haven’t scoped it yet -
I’ll try to work out if it is possible in the coming week.</li>
  <li>Linux support - There is now a Linux build for internal testing, so
far it has performed just like the PC/Mac version with the exception of
a few cosmetic issues. This task is looking good. Strangely, my Linux
version has issues with anti-aliasing which has meant the height-markers
for all versions have needed to change.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes - there are now four minor bugs outstanding I’ll be starting
work on over the next week. A few other minor bug fixes will be in the
next release, plus a major online game fix that has already been
released. Please let me know if you see anything “weird” or “wrong”.</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications - Just started work on this and the
documentation is making a great deal more sense than the last time I
looked. Confident I can get it done.</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions - a little balance work has been
done (coolers will be nerfed in 1.1) and I have ideas for more things
here, but am currently uncertain if I should do an extra couple of
missions or a new skirmish type first - I might only have time for one
(but will of course try for both).</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns - see above, if you have any ideas let me know.</li>
  <li>Online improvements - probably will not make it far enough to do
anything here, but if I do it will be something small</li>
</ul>

<p>There it is. I would say progress so far is better than expected
(especially considering the hard drive crash), but who knows how things
will go for the remainder of the month. In any case, be assured I am
working hard trying to improve the game!</p>

        <p><p>It takes more than one game to become a successful game studio. A
portfolio of games is required to spread risk. This is even more the
case for Jarrah Technology, as on current trends Concealed Intent will
not be a financial success. I am committed to a 1.1 update and have
started work towards that goal. However, realistically any time spent
will not reap a corresponding financial reward. Thus with the little
time remaining to me for working on games full-time, I need to come up
with new games quickly. Luckily, ideas are not the problem. There are
exceptionally few “ideas people” in games, because everyone has tons of
ideas. Choosing which potential games deserve the risk of developing
with limited resources is the real skill.</p>

<p>Over the last four years I’ve compiled a list of three dozen “maybe
later” game ideas. They are of variable quality, but there is no
standout, clearly a winner, concept. So how to choose? After Concealed
Intent I have a few requirements for my next game. First, it must be
simple. Simple to develop and simple to play. With only a few months
left available for unrestricted development, any game I start must be
finished within 9 months or risk never being finished. Realistically,
with Concealed Intent work and other distractions, 6 months is the
maximum time. Thus since I also repeatedly underestimate effort
significantly, I want games that I think I can create in about 3 months.
So an order of magnitude smaller than Concealed Intent. This has many
implications. For a start, no story, that takes too long (or at least,
it takes me too long). Also, my next game will be 2D or 3D with a fixed
camera. Having a fully mobile camera in a 3D world adds a host of UI and
control problems. The next game needs to be relatively cheap to make
(not including my time). Being able to reuse existing assets is best,
otherwise I need to be aware of how much extra cost is required and
factor that into to likely earnings. It is a fuzzy line.</p>

<p>The game should be simple to play. Definitely no complex internal
simulation models. It should be clear what is happening on the screen
and quick to learn. This is for two reasons: it is easier to develop;
and, it widens the market of the game. Concealed Intent is complex to
play, and difficult to learn. There is a lot of maths happening “under
the hood”. This greatly decreases the number of people willing to play.
The vast majority of potential players (and press) will only play the
game for a few minutes. If after that time they are still going through
a tutorial explaining mathematical game concepts, most will stop and
never start again. Thus, my next game will just have a couple of simple
game mechanics.</p>

<p>So those are the criteria for evaluating ideas: quick, simple, cheap
(and fun!). With that in mind my long list became a short list of 4. So
I decided to prototype them. Two on paper as the technical complexity is
low, so the gameplay elements are most important. Two in code as the
most challenging part would be the programming. At this stage I don’t
want to talk too much about what each idea actually involves - it is too
soon. Instead, here are photos of each game in progress.</p>

        <p><p>Done. Concealed Intent is now fully released. No longer is it marked
with the stigma of Early Access.</p>

<p>For the next week there is a 34% launch discount on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Steam</a>, and now for the
first time it is also available on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/concealed-intent">Humble
Store</a> too (same
discount).</p>

<p>The success of a modern games tends to be determined in their first
month of release. Visibility, reviews and sales now will result in more
visibility, reviews and sales later. So I’m not too proud to beg… If you
enjoy the game please consider telling people about it and/or writing a
review on Steam. It will all help. Also, if you do see something wrong
in the game, please let me know, the quicker I can find and fix any
issues the better.</p>

<p>Right now I’m also incredibly busy trying to get the word out and
responding to people’s messages. I am way behind. One of the more
interesting things I’m doing is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/4vvrpa/my_game_was_released_today_on_steam_after_years/">Reddit
AMA</a>.
Come along and ask me anything? Everyone who comments (with a question
or otherwise) by Friday 5th August 10:00am GMT will go into the running
to win one of 10 copies of Concealed Intent.</p>

<p>Development work is not over, there will still at least be a version 1.1
update at some point. However, I think the largest part of game is now
complete. Reaching a standard I felt happy about and then saying that
people can pay for it without that Early Access caveat is a huge step.</p>

<p>Having said all that, I would also like to give a huge thank you to
everyone who played Concealed Intent, purchased it, wishlisted/followed
it, or even just checked it out. This game could not have been finished
to this level (or even at all) without your support and feedback. Thank
you!</p>

        <p><p><em>“People wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long
hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition
in event of success.”</em></p>

<p>Paraphrasing Shakleton’s recruiting notice for Antarctic exploration
works surprisingly well for indiedevs too.</p>

<p>Today is the culmination (but not termination) of nearly four years of
effort. My game, Concealed Intent, is now out of Early Access and fully
released on Steam. It has easily been the largest project I have ever
undertaken and required intense effort to reach this point. Working
largely alone in a foreign country I often found myself questioning what
I was doing. However, in retrospect, I would still do it over again -
but with a few changes (see the “What went not so well” list below).</p>

<p>After a brief (and shameless) video interlude for Concealed Intent
itself, I will detail the things I think went right and not so well
during the development process. I have tried to think back to my state
of mind four years ago, just before starting and offer advice to that
naive and optimistic person. A later post, some time after the release,
will look at the business and financial side of the game - was it
profitable: stay tuned to find out!</p>

        <p><p><a href="/2016/05/25/Steamgifts">Previously</a> I have written about my experience
running giveaways on <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com">Steamgifts.com</a> for
marketing Concealed Intent. Several people made some good suggestions as
to what I could do better, or at least differently. One of those was
asking other people for their experiences.</p>

        <p><p>One of the game development tasks I have found particular difficult is
writing a good tutorial. Of course, best would be no tutorial at all.
Unfortunately, Concealed Intent is much too complex to be playable with
the player doing a little learning first - and that complexity is part
of the game’s design. Numerous hours have been spent tuning the
tutorial, but it is still a little clunky - probably the result of my
inexperience and the nature of the game. To help overcome this and the
common subtle misunderstandings, I have created a couple of videos to
help newbies. They will be added to the game page, the press kit and
maybe even as a link in the game itself.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/czbgsBdT-Bg">20 minute tutorial on how to
play:</a></p>

video</a></p>

<p>I have also created a YouTube playlist of all the Concealed Intent
videos I can find (let me know if I’ve missed any!). It is at

        <p><p>Concealed Intent will leave Early Access and become fully released to
Steam on <strong>Tuesday 2 August 3pm GMT</strong> (8am Pacific Time &amp; 11pm where I
am in Malaysia) - here is the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">store
link</a>. The original plan was
to release a week later, but it appears a little game called No Man’s
Sky is released that day. It seemed best to go a week early. I’ll need
to get going on marketing quickly.</p>

<p>Also, if you enjoy the game, writing a positive Steam review is hugely
useful. I would be greatly appreciative, please consider it.</p>
