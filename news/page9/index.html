  <br/>
        <p><p>I have created a self-imposed deadline - next years
<a href="http://www.gdconf.com">GDC</a>. Target acquired! It is all organised and
booked. Now Concealed Intent needs to be largely finished before it
starts on the 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2015. So what is the progress so far…</p>

<p>Creating the story for the single player campaign is finished. There are
10 main missions, plus a tutorial, plus an epilogue. The plan is that
hopefully this should total around 4-5 hours of gameplay for a new
player. However, work on balance and enemy AI still needs to be done to
ensure this (the game is too fast and not stealthy enough at the
moment). Working out the story allows me to start creating the maps and
the ships (with appropriate components). That allows me to look at
hiring a 3D artist to create nice in-game representations for them.</p>

<p>On other art, the menu work has begun. I can only hope that it has as
large an effect on player perceptions as improving the GUI. The menu
work is being done by the same artist as the GUI. It was nice to meet
them to finish up the GUI work. They suggested fewer fixes and changes
than I had expected. Also, they expressed excitement about seeing their
designs in the game and being able to play it too (plus their name was
already in the credits). I found that exciting too - I feel more
confident that the game is good.</p>

<p>I’m also starting to plan for when the game is complete and I need to
start selling it. Obscurity is likely to be the biggest problem. There
are many good indie games out there and the main task will be to let
people know mine even exists. Part of that plan is to publish to social
media more often - including blogs. However, that does not not
necessarily mean this blog. There are other sites like Gamasutra that
more people read. I will start writing a series of posts to introduce
Concealed Intent and post them wherever I can - including here.</p>

<p>I’d better get started!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Do indie game developers ever take holidays? I recently returned to my
hometown for a fortnight’s holiday and during that time I was unable to
do any work on the game. It has been a week since and I’m only just
getting back up to speed on development. It is a great loss of time and
momentum, making me wonder if the life of a indie game developer is all
work. I imagine it must be, at least during the early years. First the
game must be developed, but once nearly complete there is so much more
to be done. There is creating an awareness of the game; selling the
game; and supporting the game. Of course there is also starting over
with the next game. The enormity of the task is beginning to dawn on me.</p>

<p>The self-imposed pressure is beginning to build. Last year I planned to
attend this year’s <a href="http://www.gdconf.com">GDC</a> conference with a
complete or near complete game. There are many people who want to create
games, but few who actually complete. I need to have something done to
show I’m not just a wannabe developer. Unfortunately due to reworking
the game after initial testing, there was no hope for it to ready in
time for GDC 2014, so I cancelled my plans and vowed to make it in time
for the GDC 2015 conference. At the time that seemed like a very easy
goal. Unfortunately, programmers tend to be overly optimistic. According
to the countdown timer I have on my desktop there are (as of right now)
156 days, 14 hours and 20 minutes until GDC. It will be close, but I
think it is still very achievable.</p>

<p>The first pass through the all new GUI work has just been completed. All
the professional GUI art has made the game look immensely better,
although the 3D developer art still lets it down a bit. There are a few
little annoyances to be ironed out and some niceties to make the game
feel smoother (like animated transitions when the GUI readjusts itself -
rather than just jumping immediately to the final state). Next the menu
system will be redesigned by a professional artist. Meanwhile I need to
work on balancing, then complete the single-player campaign, then spec
out 3D art work, then fix online play, then plan marketing, … Will it
never end? No more big holidays until this is done - I must finish!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Like the old cliche “to a hammer, everything looks like a nail”, as a
programmer I think many of my game-dev problems can be solved with code.
So at first many of my solutions to issues in Concealed Intent were to
add more functions onto control classes. For instance, to handle screen
size changes, each GUI element’s control class included a function that
knew how to resize that GUI element. The problem with this is sometimes
this is the only code required in such a class. Also, it requires the
resizing logic to be hardcoded and thus changing it means changing the
code. This is not the Unity way.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>The last month has largely been more of the same as last month. I’m
working on online multiplayer games (getting close!). Meanwhile the
artist is nearing completion of her work redesigning the GUI. In fact,
the first bundle of “finished” (in quotes because rework is likely, if
not expected) artwork arrived yesterday. So now I need to start adding
it into Concealed Intent and see how it looks. I’m starting to feel a
little harried. The online work just needs a last push to finish.
However, I also need to ensure the artist is not blocked waiting on me.
Of course, I also need to just get this game finished! Still, not as bad
as being back working at a bank, but I do need to keep going.</p>

<p>Recently I have been reading a few game development postmortems and
wondering what I would say in a Concealed Intent postmortem. While I
still have the whole marketing phase of the process to come (not looking
forward to those tasks!). Here are what I think (at the moment) are my
top 5 mistakes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working alone - Having another point of view on the game is
priceless, and well as having someone else around for motivation.
Just hiring an artist and talking only via email has had a large
impact on progress and the quality of the gameplay. Plus, at least
two tasks can get done at a time! There are huge benefits to finding
a small team to work alongside. Next time I will spend some time
trying to find a like-minded team.</li>
  <li>Too complex - I like complex strategy games and these ideas bled
into my game design. There is a place for such games, but I don’t
think Concealed Intent is it. Nor is a good idea to try something
complex as a first game when still learning game development.
Concealed Intent still has some complexities, but it is far simpler
than it was a year ago. Although I suspect I should have just
started with a far simpler concept.</li>
  <li>3D camera - Related to complexity. I didn’t realise the difficulties
created for myself by having a fully 3D camera with 6 degrees of
freedom (3 pan axes, 2 rotation axes and zoom in/out). I now
understand why developers lock their cameras down and there are so
many 2D games. The art and GUI and gameplay are all much simpler. My
next game will definitely be 2D!</li>
  <li>Not worrying about art and appearance - First impression count.
Concealed Intent started filled with developer created, placeholder
art. It looked ugly and non-devs had trouble separating their views
on the game from the art. If you showing other people (and as a lone
developer this is vital), then there should be some effort to make
it look good - and this may require finding an artist.</li>
  <li>Different languages for client and server - This is really just an
annoyance and probably won’t make the final list. The client is
written in C# with Unity3D. The server is in Scala. Scala is great,
but switching back and forth between the two languages causes me to
make many little mistakes.</li>
</ul>

  <br/>
        <p><p>The <a href="/2014/04/30/Update/">last post here</a> ended with plans to hire a
professional game artist to work on Concealed Intent’s GUI. Thus freeing
up time for some of the more lengthy programming tasks. Well, soon after
writing that a GUI specification winged its way to a few local game
artists (if that didn’t work the next step was local students, then the
Internet). They sent back concept sketches - all inspired by the film
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/">Oblivion</a>, is that the current
cool design inspiration? I picked the one I liked best and we went to
work.</p>

<p>So far I am very happy with the results. See for yourself. Below left is
the Concealed Intent GUI before the artist started and on the right is
the current state after 2 weeks work - much better.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP_20140430.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP_20140430.png" title="My GUI" width="360" alt="My GUI" /></a>

<p>The design work has the added benefit of someone else’s detailed
constructive criticism on how the game works. The downside is I now have
a much longer todo list! It makes me wonder why I didn’t do this
earlier. Splitting out separate work streams and handing them to people
with appropriate skills is definitely the way to go - who would have
thought! Actually, the reason I didn’t do this earlier was to keep costs
down. Now I have committed to the release of Concealed Intent there is
no reason not the spend the money budgeted.</p>

<p>Another benefit of the GUI design work is I can focus on online play - a
previously ignored part of the game. The vision has always been that
online multiplayer would be very important (for sales at least) with the
single-player campaign as a short’ish taster. So it is great that work
for online play has finally started. It is moving forward slowly but
surely. At the moment players can log in, challenge other players and
load the state of a game. I hope to have simple turn updates by the end
of the week. Then it will probably be time to go back to that todo list.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Recently I have started showing Concealed Intent to people in person.
Watching people play provides a huge amount of information far beyond
their verbal suggestions. It also results in immediate feedback rather
than waiting weeks for email responses. In person playthroughs are
definitely the way to go in the early stages of game development. So
far, it has been shown to a couple of game developers I met at
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/01/global-game-jam-2014.html">GGJ14</a>
and many people at a local <a href="https://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a> meetup.</p>

<p>The feedback has been roughly as expected. No gushing, but nothing
hugely negative either. There has been at least one “this is like
”Homeworld“:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld” comment, which I
count as a huge compliment. It has been some time since last hearing
people say they don’t understand what is happening in the game.
Hopefully the game has reached a reasonable level of complexity (I
recently removed the “percentage chance of hitting” stat, now the change
of hitting an enemy with your lasers is equal to your lock on them).
Many ideas, changes and improvements have been suggested - some I agree
with, some I don’t.</p>

<p>The most common subject of comments is now the GUI. Definitely much more
work is required here. Below is the current state of the GUI, as
designed completely by me.</p>

        <p><p>Yesterday I was working on making layers appear and disappear
programmatically in Unity3D. The Unity <span style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html">code&gt;Camera&lt;/code&gt;</a></span>
class has a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-cullingMask.html">culling
mask</a>
so that each camera can be set to only display a subset of the available
layers. This is handy for placing 3D objects in one layer visible by the
main camera, and say the GUI in another layer visible by a different
camera. This can be setup using the camera’s culling mask dropdown in
the editor. However, I wanted to be able to change the visible layers
during runtime in response to a player’s actions (pressing a key will
make a grid appear/disappear over the playing area).</p>

        <p><p>A recent Gamasutra blog posted about <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EthanLevy/20140320/213611/Escaping_the_Indie_Shame_Spiral.php">Escaping the Indie Shame
Spiral</a>.
It described ways to prioritise work and get stuff done. I work in a
similar manner and decided to detail it here.</p>

<p>The article talks about using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> or Pivotal
Tracker to record tasks and the speed of work completed. I started using
Trello; it is a great product, for an online todo list. However, as a
lone developer, the friction of typing tasks and updating progress was
not worth the benefits. No one else needs to coordinate their work with
mine and I can largely keep the state of the project in my head. Trello
was just acting as a backup and reminder for those “nice to do, but not
vital” tasks that always seem to be done when there is time (which is
rarely).</p>

<p>Instead I keep my task list on paper. Since I use a standing desk for
coding, a notebook is laid down open at normal desk height. I can look
down and see what needs to be done next. If there is something to be
added or completed I just lean down and scribble it down or scratch it
out. Very little effort is required - thoughts are quickly translated to
text. I also keep paper around to work through coding problems or sketch
out designs, again very easy and low friction. The downside is that I
need to transcribe the task list every couple of weeks as the pages are
filled. Although, that often reminds me of some of the lower priority
tasks that might otherwise be forgotten. Here is my todo list (the left
page in the large notebook) and notes (all the other pages) as they
stand today .</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/notes.jpg" alt="Notes" title="Notes" /></p>

<p>The Gamasutra article also mentions using commitments as deadlines and
motivation to complete tasks. A great idea. My original commitments were
<a href="/2013/09/05/Feedback/">alpha testing</a> (completed) and
<a href="/2014/03/09/Past_Deadline/">GDC</a> (abandoned). The article has reminded
me to set some more! So here they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show local gamedevs - I’ve met a few other game developers here in
KL. I’ll treat them to lunch if they don’t mind taking a quick look
at Concealed Intent during the meal and giving me their first
impressions. I can do the same for any game they are working on. I
should be in a position to send out invites in a day or two - just
need to get it working on my Mac laptop (as opposed to my
development PC).</li>
  <li>IGDA Malaysia Sharing Session on April 25th - in a month the local
IGDA chapter is holding a sharing session. I’ll take Concealed
Intent along. The target for this session will be a better, smoother
GUI.</li>
  <li>Reddit r/gamedev Feedback Friday - I hadn’t heard of this until
reading the article. I should give it a go (and give the other games
feedback too). For this I’d want most of the gameplay options
available (perhaps omitting online play) - probably still a couple
of months away.</li>
  <li>Alpha test (again).</li>
</ul>

        <p><p>Another long gap between updates. I haven’t give up - there will be a
completed version of Concealed Intent! Just today I renewed the
concealedintent.com domain for another year - how is that for
commitment. Work is continuing and the game is beginning to reach the
same level it was at before I sent out the alpha, and then started the
<a href="/2013/10/15/Not_Again/">rewrite</a>. I will endeavour to give more regular
updates in future. As part of my <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/02/goals-3.html">personal goals for the
year</a>, I have stated
the plan to post year at least once a month.</p>

<p>This is the point in time I had hoped to have a finished game. My target
was to complete, release and then go to the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer’s
Conference</a> in San Francisco. It starts next
week, and I’m not attending. Having been to a GameDev conference before
(<a href="/2012/09/01/Unite_Report/">Unite12</a>), I know that the most valuable
part is talking to the other participants. Learning from the talks is an
ancillary benefit. However, I also know going as someone who has never
worked in the industry or written a game is always a bit of an outsider.
Many of people want to make games, few do so. I need to complete
something to prove I can, before going to another conference.</p>

<p>Hopefully next year!</p>

        <p><p>Again a long gap between updates. This time as I struggle with making
changes to simplify Concealed Intent. I have tried to make small
modifications, but find small adjustments ripple through the system and
become bigger undertakings than expected. Forward progress was slow.
Thus I have started again - which I consider a <a href="/2012/08/06/Rewrite">failure of
sorts</a>. My only consolation is that now I have a
clearer understanding of what the resulting game will look like and
better knowledge of Unity3D. Hopefully the result will be much better.</p>

<p>Part of the problem with my old code is that it sometimes worked against
Unity’s normal flow. The result was more “server-like” as this is closer
to my previous professional experience. For example, the in this <a href="2013/02/07/Dev_Diary">Dev
Diary</a> I proudly demonstrated my Builder pattern
code for configuring a scenario. Now it is done the standard Unity way
and the objects in the scene are stored in the scene itself rather than
loaded from a data file (although that is still an option). Also I’m
working harder to keep to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a>
pattern. I tried this in the previous version too, but it became
somewhat corrupted as I struggled to get all the functionality working.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the viedo below on structuring large projects in Unity
was presented at the recent Unite13 conference (I did not attend this
year). They talk about how their mistakes must evoke schadenfreude in
the audience. Concealed Intent is much smaller than their project, but I
felt no schadenfreude - only recognition of the same issues I have
encountered.</p>
