  <br/>
        <p><p>It is time to decloak. For some time I have been developing the indie
game Concealed Intent. After years as an IT consultant, my circumstances
changed and it was time to try something different. The game has largely
been developed by myself, with the much appreciated help of a freelance
artist in the last few months.</p>

<p>As obscurity seems to be the indie gamedev’s greatest enemy boss,
introverted tendencies must be overcome. So that is why I’m writing this
blog. In future posts I’ll write on lessons learnt (both technical and
otherwise) as well as detail the last push towards completion, but first
some introductions.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent is a turn-based game of tactical space combat. Players
control their ships in a completely 3D world - hunting down their
enemies, just as they are being hunted themselves! In Concealed Intent
you know your enemies are out there, but not exactly where, or even what
they are. The fun comes from out-thinking your opponent rather than any
test of reaction speed.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP1_20141117.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP1_20141117_thumb.png" alt="Concealed Intent" title="Concealed Intent" /></a></p>

<p>The core gameplay mechanic is stealth. But how can you be stealthy in
space? Well, space is big and empty. Finding something can be like
looking for a needle in a haystack. On the other hand, there is nowhere
for the needle to hide - to stay concealed it needs to fade into the
background as much as possible. Nearly anything a ship does will signal
its presence and increase the ability of those around to detect it. A
big ship may blot out stars as it passes. Heat from engines can be
detected against the cold of the void. Lasers can be traced back to
their origin. Eventually as detection increases, a firing solution can
be calculated so that a beam of coherent light a few millimetres in
diameter can cross thousands of kilometres to strike an evasive enemy -
hidden no longer!</p>

<p>To defeat your enemies you need to devise a range of strategies to gain
enough information to successfully shoot at them. All the while they are
trying to do the same to you. Various equipment is available to help
both sides, including sensors, countermeasures and drones. There will be
a single-player campaign, instant procedural skirmishes and online
multiplayer.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent has been the last two years of my life and it is
finally nearing completion. Time to start telling people it exists! (or
will very soon exist at least). By the way if the screenshot reminded
you of Homeworld, well done, that game is definitely an inspiration. If
you read the description and thought of submarines, well spotted, the
original name of the game was space submarine!</p>

        <p><p>It is time to start thinking about marketing Concealed Intent. I’m not a
natural marketer. I don’t talk smoothly about my game and enjoy
contacting people to let them know about it. I have to force myself to
write blog posts - it’s for the good of the game. The recent <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2014/11/01/Games-In-Asia/">Games In
Asia</a> event
ended with the offer of letting audience members give a brief 2 minute
talk on any of their gamedev issues. My first thought was “I’m glad I
have nothing to say”. Then I remembered one of the reasons for attending
was to find 3D artists (more on my search in a later posting). I
reluctantly stood up to ask for 3D artists interested in helping to
contact me. In my nervousness I forgot an important point (it was paid
work). Afterwards my hands were shaking a little. I’m fine talking in
public when prepared, but not so good when unprepared.</p>

<p>This is my preparation. A <a href="http://eepurl.com/7uj2j">mailing list signup</a>
has been added to this website and to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook
page</a>. There will also be
more regular updates to Facebook and Twitter
<a href="https://twitter.com/JarrahTech">@JarrahTech</a> - but not too often
(posting should come naturally, not forced or spam-like).</p>

<p>Next comes a plan to combat obscurity - the greatest threat to indie
games. The good word on Concealed Intent will be spread by blog posts.
Not just here of course - very few new people would find them. Instead
they will go on places like <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com">Gamasutra</a> and
any others I can find. They will also be posted here with the tag
“Syndicated”. I will endeavor to keep a regular stream of them coming.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Last week the <a href="http://www.gamesinasia.com/">Games In Asia</a> website held
a evening of talks on <a href="http://www.gamesinasia.com/games-in-asia-meetup-malaysia-how-different-startups-grow-and-evolve/">setting up an indie game
studio</a>
here in KL. One of the talks was by a local gamedev, <a href="http://www.shawnbeckgames.com">Shawn
Beck</a>, who has had some success with his
game <a href="http://www.shawnbeckgames.com/velocibox/">Velocibox</a> - getting on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/317710/">Steam</a> via Greenlight, and
also procuring some <a href="http://embedwith.tumblr.com/post/98829124567/embed-with-shawn-beck">international
exposure</a>.
His talk was the main reason I attended the evening. Shawn is a few
months ahead of me (I hope) on the indie gamedev path, his thoughts
could be very useful to me. The other talks were by local, larger (4-8
people) indie studios creating
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">F2P</a> mobile games - not
quite my thing.</p>

<p>Shawn’s talk was a brief history of his career followed by some lessons
learnt developing Velocibox. He promised a more complete postmortem of
the game in a later IGDA talk (I’ll have to go to that one too). His
path to indie game development follows a common pattern: a desire to
write games from a young age, but working in the IT business until
heading out on his own in a burst of idealism. I hope it works out and
he can continue making games - Velocibox is doing “ok” on a MYR20k
budget. I’ve previously heard similar advice to that proffered by Shawn,
but the repetition is not unwarranted. He counsels keeping to the game’s
main vision and producing the simplest expression of an idea. This point
was made with a succinct quote I can’t quite remember - something a
project being finished when everything that can be removed has been and
nothing else. Good advice - I have learnt the same (the hard way). He
also suggests trying to “fail fast”, that is work out quickly if your
project is worth continuing and modify the project or move onto
something else if necessary. After the talk there was some discussion
about this. Some people suggested instead of “failing fast”, a new indie
dev should “fail hard” and thus learn better from their mistakes. I can
see the benefits of both, there is no point doing something that is not
working and devs need to get out their and test their hypotheses (like
“is this game fun?”) early and often. However, ultimately something must
be finished and released. Shawn’s last point was about engaging with the
community (do it!) and recommending <a href="http://casualconnect.org">Casual
Connect</a> as a particularly good local
conference. This advice was echoed by the two subsequent speakers -
especially mentioning Casual Connect. I may need to make plans for this
conference coming year.</p>

<p>The other two speakers were interesting in the similarity of their
talks. Both studios were set up as commercial enterprises from the start
with multi-person teams from day one (4 people seems the standard
initial studio size). Both said that visibility in a crowded
marketplaces was their greatest problem. Both started in premium mobile
games, but found that market limited and migrated to F2P instead. By all
accounts the people running these studios (and presenting at this
evening) were interested in games and produced quality products.
However, I didn’t get any feeling of passion from them, it was just a
business (perhaps a byproduct of having employees to manage and pay?).
On the move to F2P, one studio said they saw a “10-20x” increase in
revenue after the switch. Wow, that is an amazing difference - it would
be hard to refuse F2P without strong objections. The other studio said
that premium pricing was very hard when having to pay for team every
month (presumably because revenue is lumpy - high peaks when a game is
released and long, low troughs in-between). They also said that the
market expects games to be cheap or even free and this makes it even
harder to be profitable without the ongoing revenue of F2P.</p>

<p>Well done Games In Asia, an entertaining and informative evening.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>I have created a self-imposed deadline - next years
<a href="http://www.gdconf.com">GDC</a>. Target acquired! It is all organised and
booked. Now Concealed Intent needs to be largely finished before it
starts on the 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2015. So what is the progress so far…</p>

<p>Creating the story for the single player campaign is finished. There are
10 main missions, plus a tutorial, plus an epilogue. The plan is that
hopefully this should total around 4-5 hours of gameplay for a new
player. However, work on balance and enemy AI still needs to be done to
ensure this (the game is too fast and not stealthy enough at the
moment). Working out the story allows me to start creating the maps and
the ships (with appropriate components). That allows me to look at
hiring a 3D artist to create nice in-game representations for them.</p>

<p>On other art, the menu work has begun. I can only hope that it has as
large an effect on player perceptions as improving the GUI. The menu
work is being done by the same artist as the GUI. It was nice to meet
them to finish up the GUI work. They suggested fewer fixes and changes
than I had expected. Also, they expressed excitement about seeing their
designs in the game and being able to play it too (plus their name was
already in the credits). I found that exciting too - I feel more
confident that the game is good.</p>

<p>I’m also starting to plan for when the game is complete and I need to
start selling it. Obscurity is likely to be the biggest problem. There
are many good indie games out there and the main task will be to let
people know mine even exists. Part of that plan is to publish to social
media more often - including blogs. However, that does not not
necessarily mean this blog. There are other sites like Gamasutra that
more people read. I will start writing a series of posts to introduce
Concealed Intent and post them wherever I can - including here.</p>

<p>I’d better get started!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Do indie game developers ever take holidays? I recently returned to my
hometown for a fortnight’s holiday and during that time I was unable to
do any work on the game. It has been a week since and I’m only just
getting back up to speed on development. It is a great loss of time and
momentum, making me wonder if the life of a indie game developer is all
work. I imagine it must be, at least during the early years. First the
game must be developed, but once nearly complete there is so much more
to be done. There is creating an awareness of the game; selling the
game; and supporting the game. Of course there is also starting over
with the next game. The enormity of the task is beginning to dawn on me.</p>

<p>The self-imposed pressure is beginning to build. Last year I planned to
attend this year’s <a href="http://www.gdconf.com">GDC</a> conference with a
complete or near complete game. There are many people who want to create
games, but few who actually complete. I need to have something done to
show I’m not just a wannabe developer. Unfortunately due to reworking
the game after initial testing, there was no hope for it to ready in
time for GDC 2014, so I cancelled my plans and vowed to make it in time
for the GDC 2015 conference. At the time that seemed like a very easy
goal. Unfortunately, programmers tend to be overly optimistic. According
to the countdown timer I have on my desktop there are (as of right now)
156 days, 14 hours and 20 minutes until GDC. It will be close, but I
think it is still very achievable.</p>

<p>The first pass through the all new GUI work has just been completed. All
the professional GUI art has made the game look immensely better,
although the 3D developer art still lets it down a bit. There are a few
little annoyances to be ironed out and some niceties to make the game
feel smoother (like animated transitions when the GUI readjusts itself -
rather than just jumping immediately to the final state). Next the menu
system will be redesigned by a professional artist. Meanwhile I need to
work on balancing, then complete the single-player campaign, then spec
out 3D art work, then fix online play, then plan marketing, … Will it
never end? No more big holidays until this is done - I must finish!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Like the old cliche “to a hammer, everything looks like a nail”, as a
programmer I think many of my game-dev problems can be solved with code.
So at first many of my solutions to issues in Concealed Intent were to
add more functions onto control classes. For instance, to handle screen
size changes, each GUI element’s control class included a function that
knew how to resize that GUI element. The problem with this is sometimes
this is the only code required in such a class. Also, it requires the
resizing logic to be hardcoded and thus changing it means changing the
code. This is not the Unity way.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>The last month has largely been more of the same as last month. I’m
working on online multiplayer games (getting close!). Meanwhile the
artist is nearing completion of her work redesigning the GUI. In fact,
the first bundle of “finished” (in quotes because rework is likely, if
not expected) artwork arrived yesterday. So now I need to start adding
it into Concealed Intent and see how it looks. I’m starting to feel a
little harried. The online work just needs a last push to finish.
However, I also need to ensure the artist is not blocked waiting on me.
Of course, I also need to just get this game finished! Still, not as bad
as being back working at a bank, but I do need to keep going.</p>

<p>Recently I have been reading a few game development postmortems and
wondering what I would say in a Concealed Intent postmortem. While I
still have the whole marketing phase of the process to come (not looking
forward to those tasks!). Here are what I think (at the moment) are my
top 5 mistakes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working alone - Having another point of view on the game is
priceless, and well as having someone else around for motivation.
Just hiring an artist and talking only via email has had a large
impact on progress and the quality of the gameplay. Plus, at least
two tasks can get done at a time! There are huge benefits to finding
a small team to work alongside. Next time I will spend some time
trying to find a like-minded team.</li>
  <li>Too complex - I like complex strategy games and these ideas bled
into my game design. There is a place for such games, but I don’t
think Concealed Intent is it. Nor is a good idea to try something
complex as a first game when still learning game development.
Concealed Intent still has some complexities, but it is far simpler
than it was a year ago. Although I suspect I should have just
started with a far simpler concept.</li>
  <li>3D camera - Related to complexity. I didn’t realise the difficulties
created for myself by having a fully 3D camera with 6 degrees of
freedom (3 pan axes, 2 rotation axes and zoom in/out). I now
understand why developers lock their cameras down and there are so
many 2D games. The art and GUI and gameplay are all much simpler. My
next game will definitely be 2D!</li>
  <li>Not worrying about art and appearance - First impression count.
Concealed Intent started filled with developer created, placeholder
art. It looked ugly and non-devs had trouble separating their views
on the game from the art. If you showing other people (and as a lone
developer this is vital), then there should be some effort to make
it look good - and this may require finding an artist.</li>
  <li>Different languages for client and server - This is really just an
annoyance and probably won’t make the final list. The client is
written in C# with Unity3D. The server is in Scala. Scala is great,
but switching back and forth between the two languages causes me to
make many little mistakes.</li>
</ul>

        <p><p>The <a href="/2014/04/30/Update/">last post here</a> ended with plans to hire a
professional game artist to work on Concealed Intent’s GUI. Thus freeing
up time for some of the more lengthy programming tasks. Well, soon after
writing that a GUI specification winged its way to a few local game
artists (if that didn’t work the next step was local students, then the
Internet). They sent back concept sketches - all inspired by the film
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/">Oblivion</a>, is that the current
cool design inspiration? I picked the one I liked best and we went to
work.</p>

<p>So far I am very happy with the results. See for yourself. Below left is
the Concealed Intent GUI before the artist started and on the right is
the current state after 2 weeks work - much better.</p>

<p>The design work has the added benefit of someone else’s detailed
constructive criticism on how the game works. The downside is I now have
a much longer todo list! It makes me wonder why I didn’t do this
earlier. Splitting out separate work streams and handing them to people
with appropriate skills is definitely the way to go - who would have
thought! Actually, the reason I didn’t do this earlier was to keep costs
down. Now I have committed to the release of Concealed Intent there is
no reason not the spend the money budgeted.</p>

<p>Another benefit of the GUI design work is I can focus on online play - a
previously ignored part of the game. The vision has always been that
online multiplayer would be very important (for sales at least) with the
single-player campaign as a short’ish taster. So it is great that work
for online play has finally started. It is moving forward slowly but
surely. At the moment players can log in, challenge other players and
load the state of a game. I hope to have simple turn updates by the end
of the week. Then it will probably be time to go back to that todo list.</p>

        <p><p>Recently I have started showing Concealed Intent to people in person.
Watching people play provides a huge amount of information far beyond
their verbal suggestions. It also results in immediate feedback rather
than waiting weeks for email responses. In person playthroughs are
definitely the way to go in the early stages of game development. So
far, it has been shown to a couple of game developers I met at
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/01/global-game-jam-2014.html">GGJ14</a>
and many people at a local <a href="https://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a> meetup.</p>

<p>The feedback has been roughly as expected. No gushing, but nothing
hugely negative either. There has been at least one “this is like
”Homeworld“:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld” comment, which I
count as a huge compliment. It has been some time since last hearing
people say they don’t understand what is happening in the game.
Hopefully the game has reached a reasonable level of complexity (I
recently removed the “percentage chance of hitting” stat, now the change
of hitting an enemy with your lasers is equal to your lock on them).
Many ideas, changes and improvements have been suggested - some I agree
with, some I don’t.</p>

<p>The most common subject of comments is now the GUI. Definitely much more
work is required here. Below is the current state of the GUI, as
designed completely by me.</p>

        <p><p>Yesterday I was working on making layers appear and disappear
programmatically in Unity3D. The Unity <span style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html">code&gt;Camera&lt;/code&gt;</a></span>
class has a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera-cullingMask.html">culling
mask</a>
so that each camera can be set to only display a subset of the available
layers. This is handy for placing 3D objects in one layer visible by the
main camera, and say the GUI in another layer visible by a different
camera. This can be setup using the camera’s culling mask dropdown in
the editor. However, I wanted to be able to change the visible layers
during runtime in response to a player’s actions (pressing a key will
make a grid appear/disappear over the playing area).</p>
