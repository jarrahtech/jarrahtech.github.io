        <p><p>The world is in a state of flux, and so is my life. As of last week, I am no longer employed at Substantive Research. Also 6 months ago I moved back to my hometown: Perth, Australia. The plan is to take this opportunity to try creating games again. I started prototyping new ideas this Monday. These new games will be smaller than Concealed Intent, but still in the strategy/tactics genre, as that is what I enjoy. I do not plan on any future significant work on Concealed Intent. If there is a bug I will fix it, but otherwise that game is done.</p>

<p>In the next month or so, I plan to reactivate my communication channels (including this blog) and let people know what is happening properly.</p>

        <p><p>The Concealed Intent 1.3 release is out now! It is a few months late,
but finally here.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me about the 1.3 Update</strong></p>

<p>The main change in this release is the most requested feature from the
discussion boards: it is now possible to rewatch old online games and to
always see the last turn of an online game.</p>

<p>If an online game finishes while you are not actively playing, then it
will still be in your list of online games when you next start Concealed
Intent. If selected it will display the end screen with the game’s
outcome. If you want to see the last turn just click the “Replay Last”
button and it will be displayed. On the second time you start Concealed
Intent after the game has finished it will be moved to the Old Games
list - but you can still rewatch the whole game, read on!</p>

<p>At the end of an online game there is now a “Rewatch” button. Click this
and the entire game will be loaded and you can watch it from the start
either continuously (with the “Play All” button on the turn control part
of the GUI) or turn-by-turn (“Play Turn” button”).</p>

<p>It is also possible to rewatch any of your online games that have
finished in the last 90 days. Just go to the Old Games screen (available
via the Online screen) and click the “Rewatch” link next to the game you
wish to rewatch.</p>

<p>I had hoped to add rewatch to campaign and skirmish scenarios as well,
but that caused problems. 90% would play just fine, but some would badly
break due to the scripting system used to play out the turns. Fixing it
for all scenarios would require rewriting the scripting system and that
would take too long - so sadly you can only rewatch online games (which
do not have any complex scripting in them).</p>

<p>There are a few other minor changes and bugfixes - the details are
below.</p>

<p><strong>What is next for Concealed Intent?</strong></p>

<p>If there is a bad bug I will work to fix it. I can’t imagine not doing
that. Otherwise there are no plans to add more features.</p>

        <p><p>I have stated on a few occasions that I hoped to have a 1.3 Update
complete and released by the end of this year. My apologies, I will fail
to reach that goal. The plan is still to create another content update,
and it will still be called version 1.3, but it will not be complete by
the end of this year. I now hope to have it finished and ready by March 2018. 
However, that depends on whether the situation preventing me
finishing this year continues. The main issue is my “day job” for a
London startup, which has also become a “most evenings and some weekends
too” job. This job is taking so much of my time, there is almost none
for the prolonged periods of game coding that is how I best produce. I
believe it is likely that the effort the startup job requires will begin
to drop to more manageable levels in the new year (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>Again, my apologies. I have not forgotten Concealed Intent - it is just
that the 1.3 Update will be delayed a little.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Delays, delays, delays. It has been three months since my last posting,
and five months since I did any work on Concealed Intent (with the 1.2
release). Since then I have moved continent and started a very busy day
job at a London startup.</p>

<p>I have also previously said there will be a 1.3 release by the end of
the year. Given current events, how is that going? It is still possible,
but only if I start work soon. This weekend I downloaded the most recent
version of Unity3D. Hopefully by now they have fixed most of the bugs.
If I can start finding time to make some progress over the next couple
of weekends then a 1.3 release by December is achievable.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/374150/discussions/">Steam
Forums</a> about what
the next version should contain. It seems the most regular players want
the ability to replay entire games after they are complete. So that will
be the main focus of the update. I will publish a list of goals for the
update once work has started and I have an idea of how much can be done.
If there is something you particularly want, speak now, because 1.3 will
probably be the last notable update for the game.</p>

<p>Sales of Concealed Intent have continued at a steady, but slow, pace
since the last financial posting. Below is the update sales vs costs
graph. There is a nice little bump every time a Steam Sale comes around,
but in-between only a handful of copies are sold. I have covered my
costs now, but nowhere close to being able to live on the profits and
develop a second game full-time (at least while living in London). Thus
the time consuming day job.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/cpd_revenue_2017.png" title="Concealed Intent - revenue vs costs" width="600" alt="Concealed Intent - revenue vs costs" /></p>

<p>Finally, for those with long memories, it was promised that Concealed
Intent would not bundled until at least the 3rd August 2017 (a full year
after release). Well that date has passed and the game has not yet been
bundled. I have not been contacted by bundlers since that date, but also
I’m not keen to bundle anyway. Looking at expected bundle sales, it
would not make much difference to the graph above. Also now I have a
job, I do not need the small amount of money bundling would bring. So,
while I am not renewing the non-bundling pledge (because if Humble
Bundle come knocking, I’m answering!), it is also probably unlikely that
Concealed Intent will be bundled in the near future.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>TLDR; moved country and got a day job, so gamedev work will slow; but
still aiming for a small Concealed Intent 1.3 update before end of the
year.</p>

<p>It has been a while since my last update on the happenings and plans for
Concealed Intent and Jarrah Technology - time to rectify that.</p>

<p>As some of you may be aware, just this week I moved from Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia to London, UK for my partner’s work (as was the original move
to Malaysia). I am writing this while looking out on a surprisingly
pleasant English summer day. Preparing for the move has meant I have not
managed any significant time for gamedev work on Concealed Intent or my
next game over the last couple of months.</p>

<p>Now I’m set up in London, it’s time for gamedev, right? Unfortunately
not. London is an extremely expensive city, and indie gamedev will not
pay the bills, so I will need a day job. In fact I already have one (not
in games) and start tomorrow. This means my available time for my own
projects will greatly diminish. However, I do not intend to completely
stop, instead dropping down to probably just a few hours per week on
average.</p>

<p>I am now a hobbyist gamedev rather than a professional indie gamedev.</p>

<p>The plan is still to release a 1.3 update to Concealed Intent by the end
of the year. The aim is to have this include about 2 weeks of
development work (plus testing). Only now that work will be spread out
over several months rather than in a single block. This means that there
probably will not be time to work on another game until at least next
year. The first task on the 1.3 list is to update the game to the latest
Unity 5 release to help ensure future compatibility and performance.
Then work will focus on the items left out of the 1.2 release - mainly
small UX improvements. After that I’ll reassess the time available and
the scope of previously suggested “nice to have” features to see what
can be realistically achieved.</p>

<p>My next update will give more information on the Concealed Intent 1.3
plan and features.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>The Concealed Intent 1.2 release is out now! You may remember I said it
would be out before the end of March. My apologies for being a week
late, but on the bright side I now know a great deal about password
hashing and HTTPS.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tell me about the 1.2 Update</em></strong></p>

<p>Among the bug fixes and minor improvements there are a few niceties
added. Truly randomly generated skirmish maps (the 3 ‘?’ options when
configuring a skirmish). The Skirmish configuration page will now
remember the last settings and return to it on restart or just after a
scenario. Also, there are two new types of drone: the Stealth Drone, an
underpowered laser drone with some countermeasures; and the Detonation
Drone, a heavy drone mounting an improved multi-pulse laser that
unfortunately has a 95% chance of exploding when fired. Have fun!</p>

<p>The biggest change is a new version of the game without Steam’s DRM.
This will go up on other online stores like Humble and Itch.io. However,
that does not seem fair to Steam purchasers. Thus if you send me a
message from your Steam account (so I can confirm you have a copy of the
game in your Steam account) I will send you a link to a a non-DRM
version download. Personally, I would not recommend this, the Steam DRM
version is the best version as it handles online logins, challenges and
turn notifications automatically for the player, but if you have a
philosophical problem with DRM (then why are you using Steam?) there is
the non-DRM version available.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is next?</em></strong></p>

<p>As always any bug fixes will take priority over other tasks. Assuming I
am not busy fixing issues, I will be completing all the tasks required
to move to a country/continent in May (which have been delayed a week
while finishing this update). Afterwards there will hopefully be time
for some work on my next game.</p>

<p>So, the plan is I will get back to the Concealed Intent towards the end
of this year with work on a 1.3 update. That will start with the items
left out of this 1.2 release due to running out of time. Then back to
working down the list of suggestions (I read them all). As I get closer
to starting, there will be a post here with more details.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>A few events have recently occurred, with a few more on the horizon.
Thus it is time to replan work for the next couple months. First the
important stuff - what I’ll be doing. Then I’ll explain why.</p>

<p><strong>Concealed Intent 1.2 Update</strong></p>

<p>It has been too long since touching the Concealed Intent codebase. I’m
getting withdrawal symptoms. Over the next month or so I will start work
on an update to Concealed Intent. Aiming for around 3 weeks worth of
work, plus testing. Assuming I haven’t forgotten too much, it should be
out by the end of March.</p>

<p>The first and main task of this update will be producing a version of
the game without Steam DRM. Then a couple of new gameplay features will
be added (a truly random map option in skirmishes, new drones). I have
collected a few good suggestions to improve the UI, and I hope to get
them done too. If there is still time after that I’ll just keep going
through my list.</p>

<p><strong>What is Steam DRM doing in Concealed Intent?</strong></p>

<p>Concealed Intent uses Steam DRM to identify and authenticate players.
This information allows the game to automatically login players into the
online system without the need for a username or password. This is why
you can start Concealed Intent and immediately play online. The problem
with Steam DRM is that it locks the game to the Steam platform, which is
not a bad thing for people playing the game on Steam, but means I can’t
sell the game on other platforms.</p>

<p>Considering the potential impact of Steam Direct (see below), I think it
is important to loosen this restriction on myself. Players on Steam will
not notice any difference, but it will mean I can sell non-Steam
versions of the game. These non-Steam versions will have online
registration, logon and password recovery screens (and players will need
to login before playing online), but will otherwise be the same.</p>

<p><strong>Steam Direct?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/558846854614253751">Steam
Direct</a>
will be Valve’s replacement for Steam Greenlight as the method to get a
game onto Steam. Coming in a few months, it will require a flat fee be
paid to Valve in return for each game added to the Steam platform.
Estimates of this fee range from US$100 to US$5000. At the bottom of
this range I fail to see how the fee will have desired effect
(preventing exploitative games). At the high end of the range some small
devs, like me, will struggle.</p>

<p>I should point out that I know Valve has every right to organise their
platform how they want, and their stated goal is laudable. However, as a
small indie dev it would be very easy to be crushed by any changes as an
unfortunate, unintended and unnoticed side effect. Although I think it
likely that the fee will fall towards the low end of Valve’s range and I
will probably be ok, it is still a wake up call. At the moment I am
completely dependent on the Steam ecosystem and Valve’s benevolence. To
protect myself, I am going to start looking towards other platforms.
Thus the non-Steam DRM version of Concealed Intent as an initial
learning exercise and start upon this path.</p>

<p><strong>So what have you been doing the last couple of months?</strong></p>

<p>After taking a break over the holiday season, I have started work on a
new game. I don’t have a name yet and it is still all developer artwork
(amazingly ugly!). So I am not ready to show people or talk much about
it yet, although I am happy with the way it is progressing. Right now it
has reached a natural pause point. After finishing the CI update I will
get back to it with some refactoring, prettifying and expanding out of
the already completed vertical slice of gameplay. Oh, and decide upon a
name. Then it was supposed to be time for Greenlight… not sure what will
happen now.</p>

<p>I have also been playing games again! While developing CI, there was
little time to play games, but now I set aside a couple of hours per
week to play games of interest or just from my backlog. To help keep
this up I record my sessions and put them up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">A Gamedev Plays… on
YouTube</a></p>

<p><strong>What happens after Concealed Intent 1.2?</strong></p>

<p>First, I will fix any bugs that appear. Otherwise I will get back to
work on my next game and look to start promoting it. However, this will
be affected by the fact I will be moving country around May. This is
likely to also require me to find a new job as developing games will not
pay the bills in the vastly more expensive country I will soon reside. I
cannot make any guarantees as to what I can achieve in the the second
half of the year. However, I hope to finish my second game and release
another small Concealed Intent update.</p>

        <p><p>With a new year, it is time to evaluate how Jarrah Technology is
progressing and determine a plan for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Concealed Intent</strong></p>

<p>My first game, Concealed Intent, was fully released on Steam at the
beginning of August. Since then there have been a few minor bugfix
releases and one major (1.1) update which included Linux support.
Reviews are generally positive, players on the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/374150/discussions/">forums</a> are great,
although sales have been slow. Below is an updated graph of revenue vs
costs from my <a href="/2016/10/17/Release-Postmortem/">postmortem</a>. Revenue
will probably stagnate over the next few months as the effect of
numerous platform sales subside. Valuing my time at zero (never a good
idea), the game should be profitable before mid-year. Not awful, but not
a great result.</p>

        <p><p>It has been a while, so perhaps time for an update on what is happening
and what is planned for the near future.</p>

<p>Right now I am working through ideas and mechanics for Project Blockade
Runner. That is not its real name, but I haven’t thought of anything
better yet. It is still at a very early stage, and the basic concept is
still mutating (the blockade part is decreasing in prominence), so I
don’t want to share screenshots yet. Although for people who regularly
read this blog, it was one of the paper prototypes from <a href="/2016/08/30/Prototyping">this
post</a>, shown again below. This one seemed the
most interesting to me. Also, I think the basic game mechanic can be
reused as an engine in a couple of different games. So this one scored
best on interest, ease and business. You can be confident there will be
more info about this game in the near future.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the game seems to be more Blocked Runner at the moment.
My personal log says I have managed just 17 hours work on the project so
far - and it shows. What has been happening instead over the last five
weeks since the Concealed Intent 1.1 update? Well, I went away for a
week to recharge. Very nice break it was too. Many admin tasks that were
“left for later” as Concealed Intent headed towards release back in
August are now completed. According to my log that has taken 42 hours of
effort in recent weeks. There was quite a backlog, but they are all done
now. I have also been playing games. Of course this is work, really it
is! I have put some videos up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">my personal YouTube
channel</a> and
associated <a href="www.agamedevplays.com">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Also there has been a dribble of work on Concealed Intent. Two small bug
fix updates have been released. If there are more bugs discovered I will
fix them ASAP. Otherwise, I will be taking a break from the game until
the new year. At this stage I’m fairly determined to make at least a 1.2
release before the middle of 2017. After that it will depend on sales
and time. I have started compiling a list of “must-have” items for a 1.2
version. Currently there are 8 items on it comprising about a week’s
work. That means there is another fortnight or “nice-to-have” items that
I could do, plus maybe another week of experimental/exploratory items.
That would make for a decent solid release. I have a good list of
possibles improvements. Anyone who contacts me with a suggestion also
gets it added to the list for consideration.</p>

<p>I had better get back to work!</p>
