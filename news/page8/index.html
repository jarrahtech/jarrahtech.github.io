  <br/>
        <p><p>I’m just back from GDC2015 with mixed emotions. The experience was
simultaneously incredibly inspiring and depressing. At GDC there is
always an informative presentation to attend or interesting person to
meet. However, the scale of everything overwhelms. Most of my indie
gamedev activities and assumptions have been validated - nothing I heard
or saw was particularly surprising or caused me to reassess my plans.
Although it is now clear that obscurity is an everpresent threat to a
new indie developer. Many talks discussed how elusive indie success can
be (apart from creating a good game, the secret seems to be
perseverance, marketing and luck).</p>

<p>GDC week started with a shock. I had signed up for the 5 day pass
specifically so that I could attend the 2 day Game Design Workshop.
Turning up 15 minutes early I found myself at the back of a long queue.
Worse, this queue turned out to be the overflow queue for the backup
queue. The workshop was full, about 20 people had been allowed to stand
inside the room as backups incase people left. Then there was the
overflow queue for the backup queue - about 40 people would have to
leave before I would be able to join the workshop. I heard later people
started arriving over 2 hours before the start. This wasn’t the only
session I missed due to crowds. Arriving 5 minutes early for the
Hearthstone UI talk, I was greeted by a huge line, again after the room
was already full.</p>

<p>With 26000 attendees, GDC is huge, and can be intimidating to introverts
(like me). This has its pros and cons. It may be that you might not be
able to get into your chosen activity, but there is always something
else interesting happening somewhere. After missing the Game Design
Workshop, I just walked into a discussion on the AI system in Guild Wars
II and learnt a some new useful techniques (although as a result I now
want to completely rewrite the AI in Concealed Intent).</p>

<p>Many of the best activities available are not even part of the official
program, such as meeting other game developers and just chatting. Of
course being an extrovert (or being able to pretend) is a great help
here. I only spoke to a few people, but they all had very interesting
things to say. Most of the people I spoke to were also attending for the
first time by themselves. I don’t think this this is a coincidence.</p>

<p>It appeared as if most of the people at GDC already knew lots of other
people at GDC, either through work or online connections. This was quite
daunting to a quiet person on their own. Since returning I have
discovered there are many “ice-breaker” events: the indie hostel; open
party lists; the lost levels unconference; reddit meetups; and more. My
mistake for not discovering these before going.</p>

<p>How would I advise a first-timer? What would I do differently?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Know why you are going. What do you want to achieve by attending?</li>
  <li>If you want to meet other gamedevs and don’t know anyone yet and are
not an extrovert, you will have a tough time. Be ready for this.
Prepare in advance. Find people or events online.</li>
  <li>If you want to learn about the gamedev industry (both technically
and business aspects), I doubt there is a better place to do so. I
went to exactly 30 talks over the 5 days I was there. All were of a
high quality and worthwhile. I could have easily gone to 30 more
based on personal interest.</li>
  <li>Don’t feel the need to attend tons of official sessions. There were
so many interesting talks I was always either in one or on my way to
one. This meant I missed many of the happenings and people elsewhere
around the conference. If I go again, I would probably only aim for
half as many sessions.</li>
  <li>If you are a student looking for a job, you are in luck at GDC. The
one party I attended seemed to have a large number of people looking
for jobs. Walking around the conference expo I was twice approached
by people from large well-known studios asking if I’d like an
interview. Many companies had “we’re recruiting” signs on their
stalls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will I go again next year? I’m not sure. I’m glad I have been at least
once to see what it is like and to get a good overview of current
gamedev. Although the expense and time to go to GDC from here in
Malaysia is very large. It would have to be for a purpose. GDC has huge
potential for indie devs, but requires some planning if attending is
going achieve anything. I didn’t prepare adequately this year, I won’t
make the same mistake again.</p>

<p>In Concealed Intent I wanted enemies to circle the players, and not just
in a predictable flat y=? plane. No, instead they should fly all sorts
of curved paths above and below their targets. The game is fully 3D and
the enemy AI should demonstrate this. So began my affair with Unity3D’s

<p>“The life of an indie dev is always INTENSE!”</p>

<p>— Apologies to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/quotes">Alex Cox</a></p>

<p>Alright, not quite as intense as the life of a repo man, but still never
boring. I’m always learning something new. In the past week I have been
a copywriter, project manager (for outsourced art), marketer, tester,
film editor, and even amateur artist. Note, for many days now I haven’t
been a programmer, despite that being my primary skillset.</p>

<p>This has all been because of my “big nail” development process for
Concealed Intent. This basically means that I focus on the main issue of
the moment, whatever it is. As the sole dev on this project, my
attention can only be on one item at a time. Earlier this month that was
the tutorial (again). For the last week or so, the big nail has been
preparing for a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/widget/394572500">Steam Greenlight
campaign</a>. I
commissioned work on a logo (see at the top of the <a href="/games">games
page</a>). Worked on improved skyboxes. Downloaded the trial
version of Adobe Premiere Pro and created my first trailer.</p>

<p>That last item took some time. The resulting video is below. Not bad for
a first attempt, I think so anyway.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR1iwhw5KR8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Then came my first animated gif. That wasn’t so successful, but the
second was good enough to use as an icon.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/icon.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>With all the artwork complete, it was time to complete a Greenlight
submission. I did that about 6 hours ago. Now I am a professional reload
button clicker. Seriously, I have clicked reload every few minutes since
it went live. It took about 10 minutes before anyone voted for it - a
nervous time. It is currently on 41 “yes” votes.</p>

<p>The idea that 41 people (well actually 40, because I voted for myself)
think Concealed Intent is a game worth seeing on Steam is utterly
amazing to me. I feel a little burst of apprehension whenever I put up
something about the game. I try to do this regularly now to help
overcome any concerns. It works, but seeing (currently) 42 people voting
for it works even better! Now I’m super motivated - I will finish!</p>

<p>Next up is more work on the tutorial. Then I’m looking forward to
getting back to some coding with gameplay balancing, online work and
finishing a first draft of all the campaign missions.</p>

<p>Which is all a long winded way of saying, Concealed Intent is on
Greenlight - <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/widget/394572500">vote for it
here</a>!</p>

        <p><p>Work on Concealed Intent continues and the game improves. Right now, I’m
working on making the game prettier so it will look good in a Greenlight
gameplay video. More on that soon.</p>

<p>I’m also going to be going to GDC this year. So if you are going or will
be in San Francisco during the first week of March, let me know!</p>

<p>Lastly, I’ve added Concealed Intent to a couple more websites:

Promotion is becoming and increasing (and worrying part of development).
How do Indie devs find the time?</p>

        <p><p>Just today I sent out the first email on the Concealed Intent <a href="http://eepurl.com/7uj2j">mailing
list</a>. Since it is important to get the good
news out as wide as possible, I’m also putting the information here.</p>

<p>As of yesterday, this is how Concealed Intent looks:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP20150130_planning.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP20150130_planning_thumb.png" alt="Concealed Intent" title="Concealed Intent" /></a></p>

<p>Just this week the last of the scenario placeholder art has been
replaced by professional work, although there is still some developer
art in the menus. So now the game looks much prettier. This is not to
say there will not be further changes - suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>At present Concealed Intent is in early playtesting (where I watch
people trying it out). The results are promising, each playtest goes
better than the last. The game is playable, but still a little hard to
understand. The main focus of current work is making the game more
intuitive and improving the tutorial (a surprising large task). Other
tasks include completing the second half of the single-player campaign;
expanding online play beyond the current proof-of-concept; and general
polish &amp; game balance.</p>

<p>I am beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Concealed
Intent will be finished… soon.</p>

<p>I’m looking at putting the game on Steam Greenlight. When that happens
I’ll send another email asking for your support. There will also be a
closed alpha test sent out probably end of March, early April. Again
I’ll send an email asking if you would like to take part in the testing.</p>

        <p><p>At the moment there is an <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-game-design-mitx-11-126x">Introduction to
Game-Design</a>
course given by the <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu">MIT Game Lab</a> on the
<a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a> website. It aims to teach the basic tools of
game design (namely prototyping, iteration and testing) in a practical
manner. I followed the coursework, finishing with pages of notes and
heard some interesting stories. Unfortunately due to time constraints,
considering the need to finish Concealed Intent, I didn’t participate in
the the practical parts of the course. Still, I would definitely
recommend that people relatively new to game design at least peruse the
videos. The advice proffered includes many of the the lessons I learnt
the hard way. Hopefully further mistakes can be avoided thanks to the
course’s suggestions.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/banner/checkers-608x211.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The course is 6 weeks long and each week has around an hour of video.
The videos include 20-30 minutes of lectures with the rest being
interviews with professional game developers (most of these interviewees
are people physically located close to MIT or have some other strong
connection with the Game Lab so I’m not sure how representative they are
of the wider industry). The interviews largely repeat the content of the
corresponding lecture, but are also peppered with examples and
entertaining stories. The coursework involves creating a game prototype
with the <a href="https://gameblox.org">GameBlox</a> tool and having it
peer-reviewed (other students in the course evaluate your game and
provide feedback). All the content is produced with high production
values, although some of the links are broken.</p>

<p>The course starts by asking what are games and game mechanics. Then
there is a discussion on prototyping and play testing ideas. This seems
to be the central idea of the course. Every subsequent week mentioned
the importance of playtesting and iterating on ideas rather than
becoming too attached to an existing system or mechanic. Lectures in the
following weeks look at designing the player’s experience, digital
prototyping, and making the game usable through UI design and polish.
The final week examines the business of games - largely through the
stories and experiences of some people who have set up successful game
studios.</p>

<p>Below are my condensed notes on the core lessons of the course:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Playtest the core ideas/concepts of a game early and in basic form.
If possible, playtest on paper (rather than computer) as it is much
faster to create and get feedback.</li>
  <li>Don’t become too invested in ideas - be prepared to switch or even
abandon them. Early play testing helps here as not much time will
have been spent developing the idea.</li>
  <li>“I wouldn’t recommend doing more than maybe like two iterations of a
paper prototype. The paper prototype is just to test out the flavour
of an idea.” Move on pretty quickly, don’t spend more than a week or
two. Discard everything if necessary.</li>
  <li>Try to playtest with other game developers. Don’t ask “is it fun” to
playtesters, instead ask “how did you feel when playing?”</li>
  <li>Don’t always follow a tester’s suggestions. Instead try to determine
(by watching them play) why they suggest things. Address the
underlying problem. For example, if they say the game needs to be
more blue, is it perhaps because the contrast is problematic. If
they do an obviously incorrect action, is it because the game is
hard to understand?</li>
  <li>Is there always something interesting for the player to do?</li>
  <li>If a game is designed for yourself then it will be too hard for
other players.</li>
  <li>Playtest, playtest, playtest!</li>
  <li>Start with the core idea, test for fun, remove superfluous ideas.
Iterate on the concept, refine until everything (concept, pitch,
graphics, audio) is beautiful.</li>
  <li>Try to test every week or two, so the game is always in a playable
state.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to controls and people having problems in testing -
real players will be less forgiving!</li>
  <li>“The point, to my mind, of a prototype, is you really want to spend
a small amount of time now to learn the things you’re going to need
to learn, to avoid spending a large amount of time and someone
else’s money later. You don’t want to be including anything in your
prototype that is not necessary to answering your current round of
questions.”</li>
  <li>Know what success and failure looks like at every stage. What does
success/failure in a playtest session look like? What does
success/failure for the game’s release look like?</li>
  <li>The UI is the game explaining itself. Good UI makes it clear what
can and can’t be done. If the game is played badly, the UI should
ensure players understand their mistakes.</li>
  <li>Usability has to be developed iteratively, start at the beginning
and polish all the way through development. Usable UIs are
learnable, efficient, memorable, discoverable, pleasurable and
handle errors gracefully.</li>
  <li>Optimise after the fact - don’t over engineer the game. Bounce
around the game focus on what will make the biggest impact at the
time.</li>
  <li>People are most influenced by the last and first moments of an
experience. Carefully design the beginning - make it entertaining.
Games have little time to impress players. In the game’s first
moments sell: the narrative (create mystery, selling characters is
hard in a short time period, selling the world is easier); the
mechanics - show why the game will deliver a good player experience;
and/or, spectacle.</li>
  <li>Try to find unstated/unrecognized assumptions in the game.
Developers are so close to game that there can be large differences
between them and players. Test to find the differences. Sometimes
there is too much frustration instead of challenge, or more
confusion than mystery.</li>
  <li>Super success stories in game development are the exceptions. There
are not many and are they are unpredictable. Most indie gamedevs do
it tough and do it because they love it, not to make money.</li>
  <li>The barrier to game development is low with good tools and digital
distribution. So there are many competitors. Need to outwit and
outlast to rise above the mass of competitors. Use
business/marketing/press abilities. Create novel and unique games.</li>
  <li>Advice to someone who wants to be in game industry - start making
games (not play games, everyone does that) and meet people who are
making games (network!). Start with little games to learn what you
don’t know you don’t know. Expect failure, so finish quickly and
move on.</li>

  <br/>
        <p><p>A friend of mine believes that all programmers really just want to write
games. Concealed Intent is my attempt to prove him right. I’ve started
work on many games in my spare time, but never finished any. When the
opportunity came to work on a personal project full-time; creating a
game seemed like the perfect choice. In late 2012 I moved to Malaysia
for my partner’s career, but without a local job. When deciding what to
do, the idea of finally writing a game greatly appealed. So began
Concealed Intent, nearly two years ago.</p>

<p>At Unite2012, indie game devs were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhfOB6zjK28">advised to create many simple, small
games</a>. By keeping the games
simple it should be possible to produce a game or two each year -
minimising the risk associated with any particular game (and increasing
the chance of a big hit). Good advice, that I have ignored. Concealed
Intent is the smallest idea for a game I considered. It is turn-based,
so there is no need to worry about high performance; and set in space,
to minimise art requirements (the background is mostly black). As a
strategy/tactical game it is also the sort of game I enjoy - helping
keep up my motivation to finish. Still the concept is far too large for
a team of one! The problem is that not having completed a game before I
didn’t consider all the extra little things that need to be done. Two
years is too long. The next game will be much smaller, and definitely
2D!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/progress.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/progress_thumb.png" alt="Concealed Intent progress" title="Concealed Intent progress" /></a></p>

<p>After the first year of development there was a playable version. It was
just a simple skirmish, and all the artwork was developer art (very
ugly). A number of people tested it out and the feedback was not
positive. Apparently the game was too complicated and testers did not
understand what was happening. So some of the elaborate features had to
go - like relativistic physics, a fully reversible timeline, and a vast
array of possible actions each with various triggers (now there are
exactly 5 actions possible per ship - all of which occur exactly when
the player activates them). Also, the GUI is much simpler: there are
many cues for position in 3D space; and no nested input screens for
various options on selected actions. Simplify, simplify, simplify. Great
advice for an indie dev. The game is much better now. I was too close to
see that the layers of complexity didn’t make the game more fun - in
fact it was the reverse.</p>

<p>Getting feedback early and often is a good idea. I try to do this as
much as possible now. Many of the early testers commented on the poor
artwork, despite a warning that it was temporary placeholder art. First
impressions make a big difference. I can say to ignore the art, but
human nature means that people can not easily separate core gameplay
from ugly screens. If it looks bad, they are more likely to think the
game is bad. So beware giving early work to people without an
understanding of the game development process. Since then feedback on
Concealed Intent has come largely from other local game developers or
artists. Now that the art has improved, it is time to pass out test
versions more widely.</p>

<p>While Concealed Intent has taken two years to develop (and counting),
that only corresponds to two person years. Development is largely by me.
This is very hard. If possible I recommend working in a small team. As a
sole developer it is easy to become discouraged by the usual setbacks or
problems. Coworkers help keep motivation high (for me at least). Being
alone can make me glum, so interacting with the local game dev community
is a must. Take a look online in your hometown - there are usually some
local groups, and across two countries I’ve found indie devs to be
friendly and welcoming. By oneself it is also easy to become distracted
or become fixated on an unproductive part of the game. Whenever I find
myself thinking about rewriting a bit of messy code to make the design
more elegant, I have to ask myself “does this make the game more fun or
bring it closer to completion?” Normally the answer is “no” and I go to
work on something else for which the answer is a definite “yes”.</p>

<p>There are many distinct tasks required to finish a game. If the team
doesn’t have a necessary skill to complete any of them well, then
someone with that skill needs to be found. For Concealed Intent the
missing skill is anything to do with art. For a long time the game used
placeholder art. I was reluctant to get someone else involved.
Eventually after meeting a few artists at a local IGDA group,
<a href="https://www.behance.net/BlueCat-Amber">Amber</a> was hired to improve the
GUI. This was a decision I should have made months earlier. The basic
elements of the GUI had been decided for a while, but trying to work out
how to display them on the screen was absorbing nearly all my time - as
I’m not very good at it. Amber quickly improved the look and feel of the
game. I’m much more confident about final product now it looks good.
Soon other people will improve the 3D models and the music - I can’t
wait. If you are working as a sole developer, don’t be reluctant to
bring other people in to help.</p>

<p>Having someone else in the team can also help with what may be one on
the largest indie game dev tasks - marketing. It seems obscurity is the
largest impediment to indie success. The process of selling the game
needs to start early, just so people even know it exists. I’ve just
started, and already feel overwhelmed by all the advice on setting up
blogs, landing pages, Twitter, Facebook, online reviews, online stores,
YouTube let’s play, and more. Prepare for selling early - I wish I did,
there is so much to do!</p>

<p>So what next? In the push for completion I have set myself a deadline -
GDC 2015. The tickets are bought, now I just need to finish the game!</p>

        <p><p>It is time to decloak. For some time I have been developing the indie
game Concealed Intent. After years as an IT consultant, my circumstances
changed and it was time to try something different. The game has largely
been developed by myself, with the much appreciated help of a freelance
artist in the last few months.</p>

<p>As obscurity seems to be the indie gamedev’s greatest enemy boss,
introverted tendencies must be overcome. So that is why I’m writing this
blog. In future posts I’ll write on lessons learnt (both technical and
otherwise) as well as detail the last push towards completion, but first
some introductions.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent is a turn-based game of tactical space combat. Players
control their ships in a completely 3D world - hunting down their
enemies, just as they are being hunted themselves! In Concealed Intent
you know your enemies are out there, but not exactly where, or even what
they are. The fun comes from out-thinking your opponent rather than any
test of reaction speed.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP1_20141117.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP1_20141117_thumb.png" alt="Concealed Intent" title="Concealed Intent" /></a></p>

<p>The core gameplay mechanic is stealth. But how can you be stealthy in
space? Well, space is big and empty. Finding something can be like
looking for a needle in a haystack. On the other hand, there is nowhere
for the needle to hide - to stay concealed it needs to fade into the
background as much as possible. Nearly anything a ship does will signal
its presence and increase the ability of those around to detect it. A
big ship may blot out stars as it passes. Heat from engines can be
detected against the cold of the void. Lasers can be traced back to
their origin. Eventually as detection increases, a firing solution can
be calculated so that a beam of coherent light a few millimetres in
diameter can cross thousands of kilometres to strike an evasive enemy -
hidden no longer!</p>

<p>To defeat your enemies you need to devise a range of strategies to gain
enough information to successfully shoot at them. All the while they are
trying to do the same to you. Various equipment is available to help
both sides, including sensors, countermeasures and drones. There will be
a single-player campaign, instant procedural skirmishes and online
multiplayer.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent has been the last two years of my life and it is
finally nearing completion. Time to start telling people it exists! (or
will very soon exist at least). By the way if the screenshot reminded
you of Homeworld, well done, that game is definitely an inspiration. If
you read the description and thought of submarines, well spotted, the
original name of the game was space submarine!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It is time to start thinking about marketing Concealed Intent. I’m not a
natural marketer. I don’t talk smoothly about my game and enjoy
contacting people to let them know about it. I have to force myself to
write blog posts - it’s for the good of the game. The recent <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2014/11/01/Games-In-Asia/">Games In
Asia</a> event
ended with the offer of letting audience members give a brief 2 minute
talk on any of their gamedev issues. My first thought was “I’m glad I
have nothing to say”. Then I remembered one of the reasons for attending
was to find 3D artists (more on my search in a later posting). I
reluctantly stood up to ask for 3D artists interested in helping to
contact me. In my nervousness I forgot an important point (it was paid
work). Afterwards my hands were shaking a little. I’m fine talking in
public when prepared, but not so good when unprepared.</p>

<p>This is my preparation. A <a href="http://eepurl.com/7uj2j">mailing list signup</a>
has been added to this website and to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook
page</a>. There will also be
more regular updates to Facebook and Twitter
<a href="https://twitter.com/JarrahTech">@JarrahTech</a> - but not too often
(posting should come naturally, not forced or spam-like).</p>

<p>Next comes a plan to combat obscurity - the greatest threat to indie
games. The good word on Concealed Intent will be spread by blog posts.
Not just here of course - very few new people would find them. Instead
they will go on places like <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com">Gamasutra</a> and
any others I can find. They will also be posted here with the tag
“Syndicated”. I will endeavor to keep a regular stream of them coming.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Last week the <a href="http://www.gamesinasia.com/">Games In Asia</a> website held
a evening of talks on <a href="http://www.gamesinasia.com/games-in-asia-meetup-malaysia-how-different-startups-grow-and-evolve/">setting up an indie game
studio</a>
here in KL. One of the talks was by a local gamedev, <a href="http://www.shawnbeckgames.com">Shawn
Beck</a>, who has had some success with his
game <a href="http://www.shawnbeckgames.com/velocibox/">Velocibox</a> - getting on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/317710/">Steam</a> via Greenlight, and
also procuring some <a href="http://embedwith.tumblr.com/post/98829124567/embed-with-shawn-beck">international
exposure</a>.
His talk was the main reason I attended the evening. Shawn is a few
months ahead of me (I hope) on the indie gamedev path, his thoughts
could be very useful to me. The other talks were by local, larger (4-8
people) indie studios creating
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">F2P</a> mobile games - not
quite my thing.</p>

<p>Shawn’s talk was a brief history of his career followed by some lessons
learnt developing Velocibox. He promised a more complete postmortem of
the game in a later IGDA talk (I’ll have to go to that one too). His
path to indie game development follows a common pattern: a desire to
write games from a young age, but working in the IT business until
heading out on his own in a burst of idealism. I hope it works out and
he can continue making games - Velocibox is doing “ok” on a MYR20k
budget. I’ve previously heard similar advice to that proffered by Shawn,
but the repetition is not unwarranted. He counsels keeping to the game’s
main vision and producing the simplest expression of an idea. This point
was made with a succinct quote I can’t quite remember - something a
project being finished when everything that can be removed has been and
nothing else. Good advice - I have learnt the same (the hard way). He
also suggests trying to “fail fast”, that is work out quickly if your
project is worth continuing and modify the project or move onto
something else if necessary. After the talk there was some discussion
about this. Some people suggested instead of “failing fast”, a new indie
dev should “fail hard” and thus learn better from their mistakes. I can
see the benefits of both, there is no point doing something that is not
working and devs need to get out their and test their hypotheses (like
“is this game fun?”) early and often. However, ultimately something must
be finished and released. Shawn’s last point was about engaging with the
community (do it!) and recommending <a href="http://casualconnect.org">Casual
Connect</a> as a particularly good local
conference. This advice was echoed by the two subsequent speakers -
especially mentioning Casual Connect. I may need to make plans for this
conference coming year.</p>

<p>The other two speakers were interesting in the similarity of their
talks. Both studios were set up as commercial enterprises from the start
with multi-person teams from day one (4 people seems the standard
initial studio size). Both said that visibility in a crowded
marketplaces was their greatest problem. Both started in premium mobile
games, but found that market limited and migrated to F2P instead. By all
accounts the people running these studios (and presenting at this
evening) were interested in games and produced quality products.
However, I didn’t get any feeling of passion from them, it was just a
business (perhaps a byproduct of having employees to manage and pay?).
On the move to F2P, one studio said they saw a “10-20x” increase in
revenue after the switch. Wow, that is an amazing difference - it would
be hard to refuse F2P without strong objections. The other studio said
that premium pricing was very hard when having to pay for team every
month (presumably because revenue is lumpy - high peaks when a game is
released and long, low troughs in-between). They also said that the
market expects games to be cheap or even free and this makes it even
harder to be profitable without the ongoing revenue of F2P.</p>

<p>Well done Games In Asia, an entertaining and informative evening.</p>
