  <br/>
        <p><p>Concealed Intent is about stealth, or at least that is the aim (the
current build needs more work on balance). But how can you be stealthy
in space? Well, space is <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2012/10/02/Space_Is_Big/">big and
empty</a> . Thus
finding something can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. On the
other hand, there is nowhere for the needle to hide - to stay hidden it
needs to fade into the background as much as possible.</p>

<p>How easily a ship can be detected is determined by the amount of noise
it produces. Here noise is not sound - there are no sound waves
transmitted across the vacuum of space. Instead, it is anything the ship
may do that signals its presence. A big ship may blot out stars as it
passes; heat from engines can be detected against the cold of the void;
and, lasers can be tracked back to their origin. Nearly anything a ship
can do will also increase the ability of those around to detect it.</p>

<p>On this basis, noise in Concealed Intent is distance. The more noise a
ship produces, the further away it can be detected. Over time, more
information about the detected ship is discovered as the level of
detection increases. Eventually a firing solution can be calculated so
that a beam of coherent light a few millimeters in diameter can cross
thousands of kilometers to strike an evasive enemy. Although all these
actions only make the detecting ship more easily detected!</p>

<p>This is the core gameplay mechanic in Concealed Intent. Using drones,
probes, mines and decoys to detect your enemies with the minimum of
action so that they can’t detect you.</p>

        <p><p>I’m not a big believer is providing reams of stats for game players. It
can lead to many games being, well, gamed. Even when playing old
pen-and-paper RPGs like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> I thought it
ruined the fun and mystique if the players knew the details of all the
monsters. The gameplay could just devolve into little more than
spreadsheet optimisation. It is not realistic to know the complete
details of your own situation, let alone your opponents. Where is the
fog of war?</p>

<p>But games are generally not realistic on purpose.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>I have nothing to show for the last week’s work on Concealed Intent. Not
because I haven’t been working, but because the effort was spent behind
the scenes. I have been working on rearchitecting the simulation maths
(mainly for detection).</p>

<p>Originally all the simulation code was attached to classes representing
the spaceships themselves. So a ship has sensors and those sensors knew
how to detect other ships - typical
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OO</a> design.
However, during early testing a number of different ways were suggested
to handle detection and determine lock. I needed to be able to change
between multiple simulation schemes easily. Thus in the last week the
maths has been put into its own class using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy
Pattern</a>. This change
made testing easier (so I wrote some tests - and found a few silly maths
errors!) and allowed the ship classes to be greatly simplified.</p>

<p>After that it wasn’t too hard to create a builder system for creating
scenarios. Below is the new code for creating my 2-against-1 test
scenario. I think this is quite easy to understand what the scenario
involves. It can get more complicated with goals and events added, but
the declarative syntax remains.</p>

<p>So after a week, the game is largely where it started - just with more
tests and easier to modify maths and scenarios. I think it was worth the
effort. Next up, trying out various new systems for detection and lock.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>After working mainly inside the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>
environment for the last couple of months, I decided to create a
standalone build. It didn’t work! Some mouse clicks did not seem to be
detected, while others produced the expected results. I went back to
Unity3D and everything worked fine there. Unity and it’s standalone
build must work in slightly different ways. Luckily the standalone build
produces an <code>output\_log.txt</code> in the project’s
<code>\_Data</code> directory. Normally this contains very little, but
in my broken build the following lines were repeated.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="n">NullReferenceException</span>
  <span class="nf">at</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wrapper</span> <span class="n">managed</span><span class="p">-</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="p">-</span><span class="n">native</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">UnityEngine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Material</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nf">Internal_CreateWithShader</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">UnityEngine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Material</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">UnityEngine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Shader</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Thus the problem is because the standalone can’t find the Shader
specified in a <code>Shader.Find()</code> call. According to the
<a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Shader.Find.html">documentation for the API
call</a>,
shaders are only included in the build if they are used in a material or
in the <code>Resources</code> directory. The shader causing the error
was installed in the <code>Plugins</code> folder (as it was part of a
plugin bought from the Unity Asset Store).</p>

<p>Just moving all the shaders into the <code>Resources</code> directory
fixed the issue. A handy tip to remember when structuring your Unity3D
project.</p>

        <p><p>Creating Concealed Intent has largely been a solo endeavour. This is
against all the advice the web has to offer. It appears to be generally
accepted that it is best to get as much testing and prototype feedback
as possible. Playing the Concealed Intent test builds, I can see the
need a great deal of additional work. I had ideas for improvements, but
I wasn’t sure the best way forward. I’m very close to the game so find
it hard to imagine how other people would play it.</p>

<p>It needed another point of view. A fresh pair of eyes. Luckily a
workmate turned out to enjoy playing strategy games and recently offered
give it a go. This was the first great benefit of the testing process. I
had to turn my raggedy game that played more like a set of unit tests
into something that could be fun (or at least give the impression it
could be fun with more work). The result could charitably be called a
pre-alpha release. Many bugs were squashed and from a player’s point of
view it improved quickly, but it was still clumsy to control and there
wasn’t much to do.</p>

        <p><p>Space is big. Really big. Also, it is very empty. Big and empty - so how
can Concealed Intent be about stealth?</p>

<p>The idea is that while space is big and empty, your enemy is a long way
from you. Opponents 30,000km apart would be considered in close combat
and certainly too close for most stealth abilities to be successful.
First contact with the enemy will be at ranges of 1 lightsecond (the
distance light travels in 1 second - 300,000 km) or further. Your enemy
is small, far away and moving fast. To your benefit they are also frail
and have nowhere to hide. Of course, the same situation applies to you.</p>

<p>At these distances and with ships travelling at significant fractions of
the speed of light (10-30%), the key to winning a battle is determining
exactly where your opponent is and firing first. Various sensors and
drones assist detection. Acting to reduce the amount of noise (heat,
radar, gravity disturbance) emanating from your ship make it harder to
be detected. Also breaking line-of-sight by flying behind planets or
moons will hinder detection - for both you and your opponent. In the end
it is a tradeoff between actions that help detection of other ships but
also aid in others detecting you.</p>

<p>Like most space combat games, Concealed Intent takes some inspiration
from naval warfare. For an interesting discussion of common space combat
inaccuracies in games and movies that a look at <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/28/aircraft_carriers_in_space">this Foreign Policy
article</a>.
In this case the influence is submarine warfare. Before becoming
Concealed Intent, the game had the working title SpaceSub. Imagine if
there were only submarines (no surface ships or aircraft). It would all
come down to detection - who could evade detection and who could quickly
detect others. That is my aim.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>When I talk to people about Concealed Intent, one of the most common
responses is “Are you going to do a
”KickStarter“:http://www.kickstarter.com/?”. The answer is “no, or at
least not for a while”.</p>

<p>KickStarter is a great idea and has received a great deal of press in
gaming circles recently. It allows developers to basically presell their
game (or other project - it is not just games) and get the money in
advance of actually finishing. The benefit for the backers is the warm
fuzzy feeling of supporting Indie games and usually a copy of the game,
sometimes with extra paraphernalia (posters, t-shirts, etc). There are
concerns too, some people point out there is no guarantee any backed
project will deliver - the money could disappear. Despite this
KickStarter has hundreds of games raising money right now. <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/kickstarter-katchup/">Rock, Paper,
Shotgun</a> even
do a regular roundup of projects. There have been some huge success:
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/66710809/double-fine-adventure">Double
Fine</a>
raised over $3 million; <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">Wasteland
2</a> raised just
under $3 million (and it will be written using Unity3D); and as I write
this <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">Project
Eternity</a>
(to which I have contributed) has raised over $1 million in 24 hours
with 31 more days to go.</p>

<p>So why wouldn’t I jump on the bandwagon? Basically because I don’t need
the money right now and it would be a distraction. The successful
KickStarters put in a great deal of effort to impress potential backers
and raise awareness. I have no significant history or background in the
gaming industry and Concealed Intent is at a very early stage of
development. Time is better spent improving the game than creating
videos to sell it. Luckily, Jarrah Technology was a consulting company
in a previous incarnation and retained profits can fund development for
some time (especially considering my very low expenses!).</p>

<p>As Concealed Intent approaches completion the situation may change.
Artwork and music will need to be acquired externally. The quality and
quantity of this media will be driven directly by how much I’m prepared
to pay. A little extra money at this stage could go a long way. A
KickStarter then may be beneficial. I could use the near-completed game
as evidence it will be completed and the backers will receive their
rewards. It could also be good PR - letting people know the graphics
will be professionally produced. However, that is at least over a year
away, so don’t look for Concealed Intent on KickStarter anytime soon.</p>
