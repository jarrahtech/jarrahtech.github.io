        <p><p>The last couple of weeks of Concealed Intent development have been
focused on improving the way players move the camera around the 3D
playing space. Part of this magnifying the view or seeing more of the
whole scene - the same affect as zooming/unzooming with a camera lens.
This is a fairly standard mechanism in strategy games and there are
couple of ways to implement it. I am coming to the conclusion I picked a
very bad way to do it.</p>

        <p><p>As Concealed Intent is a 3D game with objects free to move in any
direction, development often throws up interesting 3D geometry problems
(see old problems
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/collinearity-in-unity3d.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/03/line-plane-intersection-in-uni.html">here</a>).
The latest problem was testing to see if an object is partially visible,
or rather, if something is slightly blocking the view. Imagine that you
have a spaceship and you want to know not only if it is visible on the
screen, but also if a part of it is behind a planet or another ship.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It’s been a slow couple of weeks in Concealed Intent development. At the
moment I’m working on cleaning up some longstanding kludges in the code.
I generally plan on doing this sort of maintenance and refactoring at
the start of a new dev cycle. Indeed, I have just started work towards
Alpha3.</p>

<p>There was a rush to get the second alpha finished before a short holiday
at the end of February. The target date was hit with all planned
functionality complete. However, I’m not happy with the result. All the
features are there, but it doesn’t work well as a whole and is less
pretty than before. This is due partly to old problems being exposed by
new features and partly because the new features do not work well
together. There are many new GUI components and game balance still off.
To some degree, I was expecting this.</p>

<p>After feedback from the first alpha, I wanted to try out various ideas
and see what worked. That was the plan for Alpha2. However, it is still
disappointing when test playthroughs are actually more annoying then
previously. I have to pass through this disheartening phase and continue
working. To this end I have constructed a task list for Alpha3. Most of
the task descriptions start with words like “improve” or “better”. There
are very few new features - the aim is that Alpha3 will be enjoyably
playable.</p>

<p>For the next release, I may not set a specific date and list of tasks.
Instead there will just be a list of tasks. I’ll keep going until the
result works well as a whole. Working to a date means may not have time
to get it all working nicely, or being a bit uncomfortable taking on
large tasks in case they’re not done in time.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Concealed Intent is about stealth, or at least that is the aim (the
current build needs more work on balance). But how can you be stealthy
in space? Well, space is <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2012/10/02/Space_Is_Big/">big and
empty</a> . Thus
finding something can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. On the
other hand, there is nowhere for the needle to hide - to stay hidden it
needs to fade into the background as much as possible.</p>

<p>How easily a ship can be detected is determined by the amount of noise
it produces. Here noise is not sound - there are no sound waves
transmitted across the vacuum of space. Instead, it is anything the ship
may do that signals its presence. A big ship may blot out stars as it
passes; heat from engines can be detected against the cold of the void;
and, lasers can be tracked back to their origin. Nearly anything a ship
can do will also increase the ability of those around to detect it.</p>

<p>On this basis, noise in Concealed Intent is distance. The more noise a
ship produces, the further away it can be detected. Over time, more
information about the detected ship is discovered as the level of
detection increases. Eventually a firing solution can be calculated so
that a beam of coherent light a few millimeters in diameter can cross
thousands of kilometers to strike an evasive enemy. Although all these
actions only make the detecting ship more easily detected!</p>

<p>This is the core gameplay mechanic in Concealed Intent. Using drones,
probes, mines and decoys to detect your enemies with the minimum of
action so that they can’t detect you.</p>

        <p><p>I’m not a big believer is providing reams of stats for game players. It
can lead to many games being, well, gamed. Even when playing old
pen-and-paper RPGs like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> I thought it
ruined the fun and mystique if the players knew the details of all the
monsters. The gameplay could just devolve into little more than
spreadsheet optimisation. It is not realistic to know the complete
details of your own situation, let alone your opponents. Where is the
fog of war?</p>

<p>But games are generally not realistic on purpose.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>I have nothing to show for the last week’s work on Concealed Intent. Not
because I haven’t been working, but because the effort was spent behind
the scenes. I have been working on rearchitecting the simulation maths
(mainly for detection).</p>

<p>Originally all the simulation code was attached to classes representing
the spaceships themselves. So a ship has sensors and those sensors knew
how to detect other ships - typical
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OO</a> design.
However, during early testing a number of different ways were suggested
to handle detection and determine lock. I needed to be able to change
between multiple simulation schemes easily. Thus in the last week the
maths has been put into its own class using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy
Pattern</a>. This change
made testing easier (so I wrote some tests - and found a few silly maths
errors!) and allowed the ship classes to be greatly simplified.</p>

<p>After that it wasn’t too hard to create a builder system for creating
scenarios. Below is the new code for creating my 2-against-1 test
scenario. I think this is quite easy to understand what the scenario
involves. It can get more complicated with goals and events added, but
the declarative syntax remains.</p>

<p>So after a week, the game is largely where it started - just with more
tests and easier to modify maths and scenarios. I think it was worth the
effort. Next up, trying out various new systems for detection and lock.</p>

        <p><p>After working mainly inside the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>
environment for the last couple of months, I decided to create a
standalone build. It didn’t work! Some mouse clicks did not seem to be
detected, while others produced the expected results. I went back to
Unity3D and everything worked fine there. Unity and it’s standalone
build must work in slightly different ways. Luckily the standalone build
produces an <code>output\_log.txt</code> in the project’s
<code>\_Data</code> directory. Normally this contains very little, but
in my broken build the following lines were repeated.</p>

<p>Thus the problem is because the standalone can’t find the Shader
specified in a <code>Shader.Find()</code> call. According to the
<a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Shader.Find.html">documentation for the API
call</a>,
shaders are only included in the build if they are used in a material or
in the <code>Resources</code> directory. The shader causing the error
was installed in the <code>Plugins</code> folder (as it was part of a
plugin bought from the Unity Asset Store).</p>

<p>Just moving all the shaders into the <code>Resources</code> directory
fixed the issue. A handy tip to remember when structuring your Unity3D
project.</p>

<p>I have a new boss, Biggles, pictured above. Now that I essentially work
alone, my hardest task will be keep myself motivated and moving forward
with the game. Hopefully Biggles will work hard to keep me in line.</p>

        <p><p>Jarrah Technology is moving. Rather than be somewhat London-based, it
will now be completely virtual as I work in remote tropical locales for
the next few years. Of course legally the company will remain British,
which requires a physical British mailing address (no PO boxes
unfortunately).</p>

<p>Thus the new address is below. Note this is a business services firm’s
address - don’t try visiting it, I won’t be there.</p>

<p>Jarrah Technology Ltd<br />
The Apex<br />
2 Sheriffs Orchard<br />
Coventry<br />
