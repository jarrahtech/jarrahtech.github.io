        <p><p>I’m back from the three day <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a> Unity3D
conference in Amsterdam. I have put my notes from the sessions up at my
personal blog. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/08/unite12-day-1.html">Day One is
here</a> and the
other days are linked from there.</p>

<p>Overall, the conference was a good experience and worth the trip. Going
certainly engendered a sense that Unity3D is a safe choice for game
development. There was a surprisingly large number of attendees. Also
some big name games were produced using the tool, including the AAA and
well-reviewed <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/endless-space">Endless
Space</a> - a game not
entirely disimilar to Concealed Intent. The demos of Unity4 looked
particularly impressive. I don’t think a small Unity developer like me
need to overly worry about performance as the tool is obviously plenty
fast enough. I learnt a great deal from the talks, often leaving
inspired and wishing I had my full development environment available to
start coding immediately. In particular, Concealed Intent may soon have
camera movement very similar to <a href="http://universesandbox.com/">Universe
Sandbox</a>, make use of structs for memory
management and I now see a need to learn more about custom shaders
(everyone’s doing it).</p>

<p>I also had my eyes opened to the business side of game development. I
perhaps went to the conference too early for maximum business benefit,
but then I didn’t know that until attending. It is best to go to a
conference with a purpose and a message. That could be finding a
publisher, advertising for contract work or just making connections. I
just went to see what was happening and perhaps appeared as a
dilletante, just trying out game development for fun. That is not the
situation, but disproving it requires finishing Concealed Intent (or at
least getting very close to finishing).</p>

<p>Onward!</p>

        <p><p>Next week Jarrah Technology is going to Amsterdam for
<a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a>, the conference for
<a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/">Unity3D</a>. Well, I’m going - so that is 100%
of Jarrah Technology. If you’re there, I’d be interested in chatting
about all things Unity related and beyond.</p>

<p>In my six months using Unity I’ve become very impressed with it.
However, I know I’m still learning and lean heavily on my background in
programming to write Unity scripts to achieve my aims. Often I later
discover an easier way built into the tool itself. Meeting up with other
Unity developers and seeing what they do can only be beneficial. I go to
the London Unity User Group meetings and they have been great, so
hopefully this conference will be even better. I’m getting excited.</p>

        <p><p>Rewriting software projects is bad and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">almost never the best
option</a>.
However, Concealed Intent is currently being rewritten.</p>

<p>Work on Concealed Intent began properly at the beginning of May after a
couple of small proof-of-concepts developed on a part-time basis. Since
then, most effort has been spent investigating how to implement the core
idea and learning the <a href="http://www.unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> library. As a
result the code became messy as ideas were added then removed and
sometimes added back again. It was becoming increasingly harder to
progress.</p>

<p>Now there is a much clearer idea of what Concealed Intent should look
like. Thus, the project was restarted on August 5th and is moving
forward at a nice rate. The earlier effort was not wasted, it is really
a large prototype. Future posts will examine some of the work done in
this prototype as a teaser for the full version coming soon. In the
meantime, here is an early screenshot showing a player’s modular
corvette and two drones rounding a small planet to close on 3 unknown
enemy ships.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>The name of Jarrah Technology’s first game will be <strong>Concealed Intent</strong>.
It is a turn-based tactical stealth space combat game, inspired by
titles like <a href="http://www.frozensynapse.com/">Frozen Synapse</a> and
<a href="http://www.relic.com/games/homeworld/">Homeworld</a>.</p>

<p>In space combat you know that your enemies are out there, but not
exactly where they are or what they are. To defeat them you need to
devise a range of strategies to gain enough information to successfully
shoot. All the while your enemies are trying to do the same to you.
Various equipment is available to help both sides, including sensors and
drones. The game includes a single-player campaign, an instant skirmish
generator and multiplayer options.</p>

<p>More information will be available
<a href="/games#ConcealedIntent">here</a>.</p>
