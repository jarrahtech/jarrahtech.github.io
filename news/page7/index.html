  <br/>
        <p><p>When is Concealed Intent “done”? This is something I’ve been thinking
about since being <a href="/2015/05/30/How-To-Get-Greenlight/">Greenlit</a>. It
would be very easy for me to just keep going forever, aiming for a level
of perfection that can never be achieved. Alternatively, I could just
stop and give up. At various times during development, both these
possibilities have appealed. However, the goal for Concealed Intent is
for it to be financially successful enough to warrant creating another
game. Although the idea of taking someone’s money for Concealed Intent
scares me immensely, it is essential if I’m to continue, so I’ll aim for
the best game I can (in order not to disappoint paying customers), that
can be finished soon’ish (2.5 years is long enough).</p>

<p>There are two pages of “todo &amp; wishlist” items on my workdesk. Not all
can be done in a reasonable time period. A balance needs to be found.
Now is the time to boil them down to the things absolutely necessary for
wider release. Then fit them into a (hopefully) fortnightly release
schedule.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>17th July</strong> - v0.9.10: Final set of ship components, new
“right-click to move to …” system, and get online prototype working
again.</li>
  <li><strong>31st July</strong> - v0.9.11: Rework some parts of GUI, like the stats
panel and loadout screens.</li>
  <li><strong>14th August</strong> - v0.9.12: 1v1 online play and supporting screens.</li>
  <li><strong>28th August</strong> - v0.9.13: Steam integration, 3 extra missions and
some AI rework.</li>
  <li><strong>?? September</strong> - Profit! (or at least, Steam Early Access!)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few other significant changes on the todo list which I won’t
do until after reaching Early Access. There are also a number of
unmentioned small issues that will be done around the larger items on
this plan.</p>

<p>Observant readers will notice these plans start with a release
yesterday. Behold! <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">It can be downloaded
here</a>.
So far, so good. Below is an image of the old stats panel (to be updated
next) with the new components. Can you work out what they do? They are
the 5 icons underneath “Sensors/Weapons”, although they are neither
sensors or weapons - that text will change.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/new_components.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/new_components.png" width="600" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In the leadup to getting on Steam, I’ll have to start marketing again
and reaching out to people. One of the benefits of being Greenlit was I
could let marketing slide for a while and focus on finishing Concealed
Intent. Soon, I’ll have to go back to time-intensive PR activities and
consequently dev work will slow again. Another reason to get these major
items off the todo list. The addition of online play and extra missions
will mean the original vision for Concealed Intent will be complete. The
only extra “nice to have” functionality will be full modding support.
However, that will take far too long and so have to wait for a future
update - if the game is successful.</p>

<p>Better get back to development!</p>

        <p><p>Part of indie game development is letting people know about your game.
Luckily there are a number of channels that exist to amplify your
message to a willing audience. One of these is Screenshot Saturday on
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturday">Twitter</a>,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/search?q=flair%3ASSS&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on">Reddit</a>,
and <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=24094.0">TIGForums</a>.
Concealed Intent has made occasional appearances on these, but less than
it should. I usually start thinking about images to post on Saturday
morning and often just run out of time to get it done before Sunday
rolls around (although that doesn’t seem to stop some people).</p>

<p>This time I am prepared. I have been aiming for a weekly tempo of <a href="/2015/06/12/Demo/">demo
pre-alpha releases</a> and been hitting my deadlines,
until last week. From now on I’ll aim for fortnightly releases. Work to
improve the performance of Concealed Intent and its graphics at the same
time as upgrading the Unity engine took too long - especially testing.
It is done now, and the extra week means there is some time for
screenshots! Click on them for larger versions.</p>

<p>This first image below is my favourite. It shows the planning phase
towards the end of the “Extraction” mission. The player is attempting to
escape the enemy’s greater firepower (especially that station) by using
their drone as a decoy. Thus the players corvette is deploying
countermeasures to stay as unnoticeable as possible. Meanwhile the
doomed drone is doing the opposite - flying into the mass of red enemy
contacts with active sensors blazing. The video is what happened after
clicking “Action” - not bad, most of the enemy ships fired on the drone,
but two mines fired (and missed) the corvette.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/screenshots_20150626/decoy_run.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/screenshots_20150626/decoy_run_preview.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L5WQvHvQDy8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Here are some other game screenshots I captured. They are (clockwise
from top-left): a battle in an asteroid field; trying to persuade some
potential allies and getting shot in return; the campaign menu screen;
and, targeting an enemy drone. Want to see for yourself? A pre-alpha
test version of Concealed Intent can be <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">downloaded from dropbox

PC and Mac versions <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program/">work on my

The linux version is untested - beware (but thanks if you try it!).</p>

<p>If you want to see what the game looks like just download the version
appropriate for your computer, unzip and run the app. All feedback is
welcome - especially if you find a bug! If you use the inbuilt feedback
system (click ‘J’ while in-game) then I’ll get sent some debugging info
along with your feedback.</p>

<p>There is still a long way to go and lots of further work to do (better
campaign, AI and online play being the larger tasks). But this version
should give a good taste of what is to come! Fingers crossed there are
no major bugs! I’ll keep the link updated with the latest version while
there are still alpha releases.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/offscreen_pointers.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/offscreen_pointers.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The main reason I’m putting out these early versions is for the
feedback. Comments from testers definitely make a difference when
developing a game. One of the reasonably large changes to Concealed
Intent from playtesters is the removal of the “map mode”. Players never
seemed to use it. So now it is gone, with the “here is everything”
functionality replaced with arrows on the edge of screen pointing to
entities offscreen. Hovering over the arrow shows the current display
name of that entity and clicking on it centres the screen on that
entity. What else do you think should change?</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Among Gamasutra bloggers there appears to be a common tradition of
detailing the methods employed to successfully pass through Steam
Greenlight. Often these blogs amaze the reader with stunningly short
periods of time in purgatory (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChadAta/20150311/238454/20_Days_on_Steam_Greenlight.php">20
days</a>,
<a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/PatrickCorrieri/20150417/241354/Greenlit_in_7_days_one_games_journey.php">7
days</a>,
or the best I’ve seen, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SvyatoslavCherkasov/20150130/235409/How_to_get_greenlit_in_5_days.php">5
days</a>).
I’ve devoured these tutorials and tried to follow their instructions.
The result? My game, Concealed Intent, took just under 100 days to pass
through Greenlight, and I have no idea how this was achieved.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/greenlit.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/greenlit.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Most of the other games’ posts make useful suggestions. Use animated
gifs to catch a browser’s attention. Have a good and short trailer (90
seconds or under). Use BBCode to include images in well organised
description text. Basically assume that people coming to your Greenlight
page will be looking for a few seconds before moving onto the next one.
You need to quickly attract their attention long enough for them to
spend a few more seconds to vote “Yes”. All this advice was followed on
the Concealed Intent page. I think it paid off - 42% of people voted
“Yes” (compared to a top 50 average of 26% at the time of being
greenlit). Of course, converting visitors into “Yes” votes is only half
the equation.</p>

<p>You first need to get people to visit your game’s page. I would guess on
the order of 1000-&gt;2000 people came
through Steam itself to my page, mostly in the first week while it still
appeared on the front page of Greenlight. About 70% of people vote and
if 40% of those are converted to “Yes” votes, then the total is
300-&gt;500 - still a long way from the top 100 (at present just
under 2000 votes). Here suggestions range from contacting all your
friends, posting screenshots to twitter (don’t forget the hashtags!),
and just continually pushing a media presence. It is hard work and takes
up a great deal of time. As a sole developer, I found myself having to
choose between promotion and development. In the end I just oscillated
between the two doing neither job properly.</p>

<p>One method of promotion I did not use (and I think this had a large
impact on being greenlit) is bundling or key giveaways. Valve has stated
that <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/564958453505196032">promising keys for votes is
discouraged</a>.
However, a number of organisations will offer to help get games through
Greenlight and their plan is generally to giveaway or sell the game
cheaply while asking the receiver to vote “Yes” (which is clearly in
their interest). The effect can be impressive (see
<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JeremyDavis/20150427/241973/Project_Tarvotan__Our_Greenlight_Story.php">here</a>
and
<a href="http://aerosquest.com/development/aeros-quest-has-been-greenlit-the-story-the-campaign-and-the-stats-revealed/">here</a>).
An anecdotal survey of games in a bundle showed that most were greenlit
within a fortnight of the sale starting. So it works, and fast. There
are arguments to be made that such techniques are not in violation of
Valve’s policy, but I believe it is against the spirit of Greenlight so
I avoided them.</p>

<p>So how did I drive people to the Concealed Intent Greenlight page? I
didn’t. At least not successfully in any meaningful numbers. I used
Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, IndieDB. I kept blogs on my own websites and
Gamasutra and TIGSource. By the end of the campaign I had around 2250
visitors and 690 votes, corresponding to around 42% of the way to the
top 100. I was about to shift back into big PR push when the email
arrived saying I had been greenlit. Thank you, thank you, thank you to
whomever at Valve decided Concealed Intent was worthy!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/unbalanced.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/unbalanced.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Originally I thought Greenlight was to prove a market exists for your
game - thus the need for a large number of votes. Now I think the
purpose of Greenlight is to avoid “bad” games? So it is not about
building a market, so much as catching the attention of Valve’s Steam
custodians (with Greenlight a better way of doing this than the old
system of emailing and bothering Valve until accepted onto the
platform). Getting lots of votes is still the most likely way of
achieving this, but not the only way.</p>

<p>So my advice? For what it’s worth, I think the best plan is to produce a
polished game, find real customers and avoid selling out cheaply. If the
game doesn’t immediately take off on Greenlight, do not be disheartened - instead grind it out over time with continual PR. Of course, all this
assumes you have a good game - that should be your first and main goal!</p>

        <p><p>One of the difficulties in creating Concealed Intent is how to handle
3D. Often when showing the game to people, the ability to fly your ship
up and down seems the hardest to understand. The plan was to copy
Homeworld’s movement and waypoint selection system, but early comments
from the latest round of testers suggested that was not enough. So after
a short discussion on reddit’s
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/">/r/gamedev</a>, I decided to more
shamelessly copy Homeworld 2’s movement system. The idea being to more
strongly signal perspective in the game and easier controls.</p>

<p>A disc showing the horizontal plane now appears when selecting
waypoints. The marker displaying the height above/below the horizontal
is now much clearer. Also the player can start moving up down by holding
down the right mouse button (as well as the previous method of holding
down a CTRL key). The amount of movement up/down is now directly linked
to mouse movement rather than a fancy (and fragile) 3D geometry
calculation. Finally once wayponts have been set, it is now possible to
click and drag the last waypoint to a new position (an idea given by a
tester through the <a href="/2015/03/26/Feedback/!">feedback system</a>).</p>

        <p><p>Time for another update on Concealed Intent. The latest news is that I
just finished spending a week to allow games to be saved and then
replayed. It works very nicely. The main benefit of this (apart from
being cool:) is that when people leave online
<a href="/2015/03/26/Feedback/">feedback</a> they also leave the log of their last
played mission, which I can now review to see what they were seeing at
the time. Of course, while all this mucking about in JSON serialization
and the gameplay engine was great fun and useful, it does not help get
the game better noticed or greenlit.</p>

<p>Marketing is now something constantly in the back of my mind. “Will this
make a nice screenshot for Twitter?” “Can I blog about this on
Gamasutra?” “What needs to be done before I can release a demo version?”
As of today I am 40% of the way to the top100 on Greenlight and the pace
of yes votes has greatly slowed. I’m hoping that a demo version and
accompanying media push will improve that situation. In the meantime, I
work on the occasional graphical nicety in order to keep up a trickle of
screenshots/updates and thus a corresponding trickle of votes. Thus,
after the week of engine work, I spent an afternoon playing around with
movement trails. The resulting screenshot is below.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/movetrails.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/movetrails.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Last week an early demo copy of Concealed Intent was sent out to mailing
list subscribers. So far there has been little feedback, but that has
always been my experience with such things. One person has said that
vertical movement is difficult to understand - an issue that is already
on my todo list as a “maybe”, so it will probably become a “definite”
now. My todo list is full of tasks leading to make a better early access
demo. As the the demo improves it will be distributed through more
popular channels (Greenlight, Facebook, Twitter, blogs, IndieDb, Reddit,
etc). The first task on this list is completing the first draft of the
single-player campaign, as this will determine if any more changes to
general gameplay are required. Then work on balance and AI. Then some
GUI improvements like the vertical movement issue, plus a way of
identifying ships without plans; direction pointers to off-screen ships;
and, a better loadout screen. After that, I don’t know, it depends on
how feedback for the demo goes.</p>

<p>Anyway back to work!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>At an early stage of Concealed Intent’s development I sent it out online
to get feedback from people who expressed an interest in the game. There
were very few replies and most of those were just of the form “yeah,
it’s ok.” As a result I started doing playtesting while sitting next to
the victim/tester. This is a much better technique - a huge amount of
information is gleaned from just watching someone else play, any
comments are a bonus. However, it does not scale, especially as a sole
indie developer. So in the background I continued to try finding a
better way.</p>

<p>At GDC <a href="https://twitter.com/hugh_jeremy">Hugh Jeremy</a> presented
<a href="http://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/">Subnautica’s</a> feedback system. Oh
yeah, this is what I wanted. Being a proud member of the “break’n’enter”
school of game design, I had the <a href="https://github.com/hwjeremy/snfeedback">example code and presentation
slides</a> downloaded within
minutes. Now a similar feedback system is built into Concealed Intent.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/feedback.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/feedback.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>As developers we need to make it as frictionless as possible for players
to communicate feedback to us - otherwise most won’t bother. This is the
beauty of the Subnautica system (and my reimplementation).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collect feedback from within the game. Don’t make the player switch
to a different application. Create an in-game screen that can send the
feedback automatically to an online collection system.</li>
  <li>Ensure there is a quick-key to jump straight to the feedback screen
from anywhere within the game. When the player has something to say,
ensure they can reach the screen quickly.</li>
  <li>Collect minimal information from the player. The more information
fields, the more intimidating. Concealed Intent has just 2 text boxes
and a submit button. If the player has an online account (like Steam)
then one of the fields is filled in for them.</li>
  <li>Collect the player’s emotion. This is a brilliant idea from
Subnautica, there are a range of emoticons each acting as a submit
button. So there is always a guide to what the player is feeling when
they provide feedback. Overtime hopefully more positive emotions will
dominate.</li>
  <li>Make as much of what is collected optional. Other than the clicking
the submit button, nothing is required in the Concealed Intent feedback
screen.</li>
  <li>Add extra information behind the scenes. As Concealed Intent is
turn-based and already logs game events, the feedback system just adds
this log to the submission without the player’s interaction.
Screenshots, framerates and other game info could also be added to aid
diagnosing bugs.</li>
  <li>But don’t send anything personal or identifying! Make sure the system
is safe and will not compromise the player’s privacy.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">Hash</a> login
id’s and other personal info if it’s absolutely necessary to have them
in the feedback.</li>
  <li>Have a back-end system to handle the feedback. A simple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
website should be enough. <a href="http://subnautica.unknownworlds.com/#/subnautica/feedback">Subnatica’s
system</a> is
public</li>
  <li>Think about rewarding the player for leaving feedback. Subnautica has
a Steam achievement for feedback.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>

\~13% of
<a href="https://twitter.com/Subnautica">`Subnautica</a> players choose to submit development feedback in-game: <a href="http://t.co/nMl6M2Jznm">http://t.co/nMl6M2Jznm</a> <a href="http://t.co/VcJeQvLZ7A">pic.twitter.com/VcJeQvLZ7A</a></p>&mdash; Hugh Jeremy (`hugh\_jeremy)

<p>How well the feedback system works when live is something for a
postmortem. Although it seems to be working well for Subnautica so far
(13% may not sound like much, but I’d be happy with that). It should at
least work better than my previous system!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>I’m just back from GDC2015 with mixed emotions. The experience was
simultaneously incredibly inspiring and depressing. At GDC there is
always an informative presentation to attend or interesting person to
meet. However, the scale of everything overwhelms. Most of my indie
gamedev activities and assumptions have been validated - nothing I heard
or saw was particularly surprising or caused me to reassess my plans.
Although it is now clear that obscurity is an everpresent threat to a
new indie developer. Many talks discussed how elusive indie success can
be (apart from creating a good game, the secret seems to be
perseverance, marketing and luck).</p>

<p>GDC week started with a shock. I had signed up for the 5 day pass
specifically so that I could attend the 2 day Game Design Workshop.
Turning up 15 minutes early I found myself at the back of a long queue.
Worse, this queue turned out to be the overflow queue for the backup
queue. The workshop was full, about 20 people had been allowed to stand
inside the room as backups incase people left. Then there was the
overflow queue for the backup queue - about 40 people would have to
leave before I would be able to join the workshop. I heard later people
started arriving over 2 hours before the start. This wasn’t the only
session I missed due to crowds. Arriving 5 minutes early for the
Hearthstone UI talk, I was greeted by a huge line, again after the room
was already full.</p>

<p>With 26000 attendees, GDC is huge, and can be intimidating to introverts
(like me). This has its pros and cons. It may be that you might not be
able to get into your chosen activity, but there is always something
else interesting happening somewhere. After missing the Game Design
Workshop, I just walked into a discussion on the AI system in Guild Wars
II and learnt a some new useful techniques (although as a result I now
want to completely rewrite the AI in Concealed Intent).</p>

<p>Many of the best activities available are not even part of the official
program, such as meeting other game developers and just chatting. Of
course being an extrovert (or being able to pretend) is a great help
here. I only spoke to a few people, but they all had very interesting
things to say. Most of the people I spoke to were also attending for the
first time by themselves. I don’t think this this is a coincidence.</p>

<p>It appeared as if most of the people at GDC already knew lots of other
people at GDC, either through work or online connections. This was quite
daunting to a quiet person on their own. Since returning I have
discovered there are many “ice-breaker” events: the indie hostel; open
party lists; the lost levels unconference; reddit meetups; and more. My
mistake for not discovering these before going.</p>

<p>How would I advise a first-timer? What would I do differently?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Know why you are going. What do you want to achieve by attending?</li>
  <li>If you want to meet other gamedevs and don’t know anyone yet and are
not an extrovert, you will have a tough time. Be ready for this.
Prepare in advance. Find people or events online.</li>
  <li>If you want to learn about the gamedev industry (both technically
and business aspects), I doubt there is a better place to do so. I
went to exactly 30 talks over the 5 days I was there. All were of a
high quality and worthwhile. I could have easily gone to 30 more
based on personal interest.</li>
  <li>Don’t feel the need to attend tons of official sessions. There were
so many interesting talks I was always either in one or on my way to
one. This meant I missed many of the happenings and people elsewhere
around the conference. If I go again, I would probably only aim for
half as many sessions.</li>
  <li>If you are a student looking for a job, you are in luck at GDC. The
one party I attended seemed to have a large number of people looking
for jobs. Walking around the conference expo I was twice approached
by people from large well-known studios asking if I’d like an
interview. Many companies had “we’re recruiting” signs on their
stalls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will I go again next year? I’m not sure. I’m glad I have been at least
once to see what it is like and to get a good overview of current
gamedev. Although the expense and time to go to GDC from here in
Malaysia is very large. It would have to be for a purpose. GDC has huge
potential for indie devs, but requires some planning if attending is
going achieve anything. I didn’t prepare adequately this year, I won’t
make the same mistake again.</p>

<p>In Concealed Intent I wanted enemies to circle the players, and not just
in a predictable flat y=? plane. No, instead they should fly all sorts
of curved paths above and below their targets. The game is fully 3D and
the enemy AI should demonstrate this. So began my affair with Unity3D’s
