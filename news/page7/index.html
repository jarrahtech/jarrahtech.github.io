        <p><p>It is time to bite the bullet and set a release date:</p>

<p><strong>19 <sup>th</sup> November 2015</strong></p>

<p>On that day Concealed Intent with be released onto Steam Early Access.
The price will be US$14.99 (or whatever Steam converts that into for
your local currency), but there will be a 20% discount for the first
week. Note that Early Access does not meant the game is finished. Quite
the opposite, it means that work is ongoing and that I hope that players
will help me by leaving feedback - especially on game balance.</p>

<p>I’ve also kept up a background marketing task, I now have more places on
the web details on the game can be found. So many it is getting hard to
keep track of them all! Anyway here are the new ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">Steam Store Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dodistribute.com/access/KkO7lRlDYp/">Do Distribute()</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://madewith.unity.com/games/concealed-intent">Made With Unity</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I have already discovered about releasing a game, is that you
are immediately deluged with people asking for free copies, usually in
return for a review. I don’t mind this, but it does take some time to go
through them and ensure they are genuine. Unfortunately most cannot be
confirmed, and with the scourge of key resellers ever present, I am
hesitant to give a key (or multiple keys as is usually requested). My
advice to people requesting keys is firstly, make it clear and easily
checked you are who you say you are. Secondly, ask for a single key
unless you have a good (and explicit stated) reason for more.</p>

        <p><p>Creating an indie game is never just a matter of writing code (I wish!).
There is also always some marketing - even the <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf
Fortress</a> people spend some time
telling the world about their game. Concealed Intent is no exception. I
may not find it easy or enjoyable, but it needs to be done. So for the
last 5 days no work on the game itself has been completed. Instead I
have created trailers, screenshots and copy. Next up is more
mission/balance/AI work (am I sounding like a stuck record?).</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It has been a while since I last updated everyone on Concealed Intent’s
progress. This is not because little has been happening - quite the
opposite! I have been working so much almost everything else has fallen
away - most notably exercise and keeping up with people. In the last
week I’ve left the house twice, both times just to buy food. It is
crunch time on the project, but since this is a one-person project, I’m
doing it to myself and have no one else to blame. However, today a major
goal was “finished” (in quotes as it is never really finished), so I
have a little downtime. Partly this is because Unity has said they may
release fix for a bug that has plagued me the last fortnight, and I
decided to wait a little for it before releasing the latest build. There
is a workaround for the bug, but that has its own issues. So here’s
hoping that they do fix it and soon!</p>

<p>Since the start of September more online functionality, a soundtrack, a
modular narrative system, random skirmish generation, a splash screen
and various bug fixes have been added to the game. However, the biggest
change is to the controls, GUI and tutorial. By mid September, I was
feeling quite confident in the quality of Concealed Intent and began
planning to put it on Steam. First there was to be the final playtests.
Unfortunately, those playtests did not go well. The general view was
that it was hard to tell what was going on in the tute, the game broke
certain conventions and there was just too much clicking. Oh well. I was
in quite the funk for a few days afterwards, wondering if the game was a
failure. Recovery came through talking to a couple of local gamedevs
(thanks guys!) and now the GUI has greatly changed - movement and
targeting can be done with a single click, sub panels (noise, components
&amp; log) have been removed, the tutorial completely rewritten and a
selection indicator added.</p>

<p>Now once again I think the game is ready for Steam Early Access. If its
not, I’ll probably just release it anyway because I can’t keep working
on this game forever. It must end soon. There is the “workaround”
version on dropbox now (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">available
here</a>).
hopefully to be replaced with the fixed version soon. Then it is time to
put this version out for comments. Then I’ll work to get a private beta
on Steam (sending keys to all those that have helped along the way),
while at the same time improving my (nearly non-existent) marketing
materials - including this website.</p>

        <p><p>So <a href="/2015/07/18/The-Best-Laid-Plans/">my last post</a> (some time ago!)
plotted out a path to finishing (or at least Steam Early Access). Who
spotted the obvious error in the plan? If you said “two weeks to finish
an online server is a little ambitious”, then congratulations you are
absolutely correct.</p>

<p>It is now a fortnight past when I hoped to have such a server completed,
and it is only just usable. Players can register, search for duels, and
play a game. They can even concede the game if they wish. There are no
outstanding bugs, but there is still more to do. The last “must do” item
is adding timers to the turns so a player can’t just abandon a game
leaving their opponent hanging. Other than that there are a few things I
should add, but can wait until later, including: a coop mode; bots if no
player opponents are available; player ranking systems with better
match-making; Steam user auto-registration; and, many performance
improvements (at the moment my home PC can probably support about a
hundred simultaneous games).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/initial_online.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/initial_online.png" width="600" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>As it is not completely done, this release will be skipped, it will not
be available on the Dropbox folder. Instead 0.9.12 will be an internal
release and now I’ll start on 0.9.13 as the final alpha release
available before heading onto Early Access. Of course I’m already two
weeks behind, so now the goal is for a mid-September release, and
October for getting on Steam. The main tasks are fixing up the narrative
messages, adding a soundtrack, adding more missions, AI improvements,
Steam integration and of course those damn turn timers!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>When is Concealed Intent “done”? This is something I’ve been thinking
about since being <a href="/2015/05/30/How-To-Get-Greenlight/">Greenlit</a>. It
would be very easy for me to just keep going forever, aiming for a level
of perfection that can never be achieved. Alternatively, I could just
stop and give up. At various times during development, both these
possibilities have appealed. However, the goal for Concealed Intent is
for it to be financially successful enough to warrant creating another
game. Although the idea of taking someone’s money for Concealed Intent
scares me immensely, it is essential if I’m to continue, so I’ll aim for
the best game I can (in order not to disappoint paying customers), that
can be finished soon’ish (2.5 years is long enough).</p>

<p>There are two pages of “todo &amp; wishlist” items on my workdesk. Not all
can be done in a reasonable time period. A balance needs to be found.
Now is the time to boil them down to the things absolutely necessary for
wider release. Then fit them into a (hopefully) fortnightly release
schedule.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>17th July</strong> - v0.9.10: Final set of ship components, new
“right-click to move to …” system, and get online prototype working
again.</li>
  <li><strong>31st July</strong> - v0.9.11: Rework some parts of GUI, like the stats
panel and loadout screens.</li>
  <li><strong>14th August</strong> - v0.9.12: 1v1 online play and supporting screens.</li>
  <li><strong>28th August</strong> - v0.9.13: Steam integration, 3 extra missions and
some AI rework.</li>
  <li><strong>?? September</strong> - Profit! (or at least, Steam Early Access!)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few other significant changes on the todo list which I won’t
do until after reaching Early Access. There are also a number of
unmentioned small issues that will be done around the larger items on
this plan.</p>

<p>Observant readers will notice these plans start with a release
yesterday. Behold! <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">It can be downloaded
here</a>.
So far, so good. Below is an image of the old stats panel (to be updated
next) with the new components. Can you work out what they do? They are
the 5 icons underneath “Sensors/Weapons”, although they are neither
sensors or weapons - that text will change.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/new_components.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/new_components.png" width="600" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In the leadup to getting on Steam, I’ll have to start marketing again
and reaching out to people. One of the benefits of being Greenlit was I
could let marketing slide for a while and focus on finishing Concealed
Intent. Soon, I’ll have to go back to time-intensive PR activities and
consequently dev work will slow again. Another reason to get these major
items off the todo list. The addition of online play and extra missions
will mean the original vision for Concealed Intent will be complete. The
only extra “nice to have” functionality will be full modding support.
However, that will take far too long and so have to wait for a future
update - if the game is successful.</p>

<p>Better get back to development!</p>

        <p><p>Part of indie game development is letting people know about your game.
Luckily there are a number of channels that exist to amplify your
message to a willing audience. One of these is Screenshot Saturday on
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturday">Twitter</a>,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/search?q=flair%3ASSS&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on">Reddit</a>,
and <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=24094.0">TIGForums</a>.
Concealed Intent has made occasional appearances on these, but less than
it should. I usually start thinking about images to post on Saturday
morning and often just run out of time to get it done before Sunday
rolls around (although that doesn’t seem to stop some people).</p>

<p>This time I am prepared. I have been aiming for a weekly tempo of <a href="/2015/06/12/Demo/">demo
pre-alpha releases</a> and been hitting my deadlines,
until last week. From now on I’ll aim for fortnightly releases. Work to
improve the performance of Concealed Intent and its graphics at the same
time as upgrading the Unity engine took too long - especially testing.
It is done now, and the extra week means there is some time for
screenshots! Click on them for larger versions.</p>

<p>This first image below is my favourite. It shows the planning phase
towards the end of the “Extraction” mission. The player is attempting to
escape the enemy’s greater firepower (especially that station) by using
their drone as a decoy. Thus the players corvette is deploying
countermeasures to stay as unnoticeable as possible. Meanwhile the
doomed drone is doing the opposite - flying into the mass of red enemy
contacts with active sensors blazing. The video is what happened after
clicking “Action” - not bad, most of the enemy ships fired on the drone,
but two mines fired (and missed) the corvette.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/screenshots_20150626/decoy_run.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/screenshots_20150626/decoy_run_preview.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Here are some other game screenshots I captured. They are (clockwise
from top-left): a battle in an asteroid field; trying to persuade some
potential allies and getting shot in return; the campaign menu screen;
and, targeting an enemy drone. Want to see for yourself? A pre-alpha

PC and Mac versions <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program/">work on my

The linux version is untested - beware (but thanks if you try it!).</p>

<p>If you want to see what the game looks like just download the version
appropriate for your computer, unzip and run the app. All feedback is
welcome - especially if you find a bug! If you use the inbuilt feedback
system (click ‘J’ while in-game) then I’ll get sent some debugging info
along with your feedback.</p>

<p>There is still a long way to go and lots of further work to do (better
campaign, AI and online play being the larger tasks). But this version
should give a good taste of what is to come! Fingers crossed there are
no major bugs! I’ll keep the link updated with the latest version while
there are still alpha releases.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/offscreen_pointers.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/offscreen_pointers.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The main reason I’m putting out these early versions is for the
feedback. Comments from testers definitely make a difference when
developing a game. One of the reasonably large changes to Concealed
Intent from playtesters is the removal of the “map mode”. Players never
seemed to use it. So now it is gone, with the “here is everything”
functionality replaced with arrows on the edge of screen pointing to

        <p><p>Among Gamasutra bloggers there appears to be a common tradition of
detailing the methods employed to successfully pass through Steam
Greenlight. Often these blogs amaze the reader with stunningly short
periods of time in purgatory (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChadAta/20150311/238454/20_Days_on_Steam_Greenlight.php">20
days</a>,
<a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/PatrickCorrieri/20150417/241354/Greenlit_in_7_days_one_games_journey.php">7
days</a>,
or the best I’ve seen, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SvyatoslavCherkasov/20150130/235409/How_to_get_greenlit_in_5_days.php">5
days</a>).
I’ve devoured these tutorials and tried to follow their instructions.
The result? My game, Concealed Intent, took just under 100 days to pass
through Greenlight, and I have no idea how this was achieved.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/greenlit.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/greenlit.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Most of the other games’ posts make useful suggestions. Use animated
gifs to catch a browser’s attention. Have a good and short trailer (90
seconds or under). Use BBCode to include images in well organised
description text. Basically assume that people coming to your Greenlight
page will be looking for a few seconds before moving onto the next one.
You need to quickly attract their attention long enough for them to
spend a few more seconds to vote “Yes”. All this advice was followed on
the Concealed Intent page. I think it paid off - 42% of people voted
“Yes” (compared to a top 50 average of 26% at the time of being
greenlit). Of course, converting visitors into “Yes” votes is only half
the equation.</p>

<p>You first need to get people to visit your game’s page. I would guess on
the order of 1000-&gt;2000 people came
through Steam itself to my page, mostly in the first week while it still
appeared on the front page of Greenlight. About 70% of people vote and
if 40% of those are converted to “Yes” votes, then the total is
300-&gt;500 - still a long way from the top 100 (at present just
under 2000 votes). Here suggestions range from contacting all your
friends, posting screenshots to twitter (don’t forget the hashtags!),
and just continually pushing a media presence. It is hard work and takes
up a great deal of time. As a sole developer, I found myself having to
choose between promotion and development. In the end I just oscillated
between the two doing neither job properly.</p>

<p>One method of promotion I did not use (and I think this had a large
impact on being greenlit) is bundling or key giveaways. Valve has stated
that <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/564958453505196032">promising keys for votes is
discouraged</a>.
However, a number of organisations will offer to help get games through
Greenlight and their plan is generally to giveaway or sell the game
cheaply while asking the receiver to vote “Yes” (which is clearly in
their interest). The effect can be impressive (see
<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JeremyDavis/20150427/241973/Project_Tarvotan__Our_Greenlight_Story.php">here</a>
and
<a href="http://aerosquest.com/development/aeros-quest-has-been-greenlit-the-story-the-campaign-and-the-stats-revealed/">here</a>).
An anecdotal survey of games in a bundle showed that most were greenlit
within a fortnight of the sale starting. So it works, and fast. There
are arguments to be made that such techniques are not in violation of
Valve’s policy, but I believe it is against the spirit of Greenlight so
I avoided them.</p>

<p>So how did I drive people to the Concealed Intent Greenlight page? I
didn’t. At least not successfully in any meaningful numbers. I used
Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, IndieDB. I kept blogs on my own websites and
Gamasutra and TIGSource. By the end of the campaign I had around 2250
visitors and 690 votes, corresponding to around 42% of the way to the
top 100. I was about to shift back into big PR push when the email
arrived saying I had been greenlit. Thank you, thank you, thank you to
whomever at Valve decided Concealed Intent was worthy!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/unbalanced.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/unbalanced.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Originally I thought Greenlight was to prove a market exists for your
game - thus the need for a large number of votes. Now I think the
purpose of Greenlight is to avoid “bad” games? So it is not about
building a market, so much as catching the attention of Valve’s Steam
custodians (with Greenlight a better way of doing this than the old
system of emailing and bothering Valve until accepted onto the
platform). Getting lots of votes is still the most likely way of
achieving this, but not the only way.</p>

<p>So my advice? For what it’s worth, I think the best plan is to produce a
polished game, find real customers and avoid selling out cheaply. If the
game doesn’t immediately take off on Greenlight, do not be disheartened - instead grind it out over time with continual PR. Of course, all this
assumes you have a good game - that should be your first and main goal!</p>

        <p><p>One of the difficulties in creating Concealed Intent is how to handle
3D. Often when showing the game to people, the ability to fly your ship
up and down seems the hardest to understand. The plan was to copy
Homeworld’s movement and waypoint selection system, but early comments
from the latest round of testers suggested that was not enough. So after
a short discussion on reddit’s
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/">/r/gamedev</a>, I decided to more
shamelessly copy Homeworld 2’s movement system. The idea being to more
strongly signal perspective in the game and easier controls.</p>

<p>A disc showing the horizontal plane now appears when selecting
waypoints. The marker displaying the height above/below the horizontal
is now much clearer. Also the player can start moving up down by holding
down the right mouse button (as well as the previous method of holding
down a CTRL key). The amount of movement up/down is now directly linked
to mouse movement rather than a fancy (and fragile) 3D geometry
calculation. Finally once wayponts have been set, it is now possible to
click and drag the last waypoint to a new position (an idea given by a
tester through the <a href="/2015/03/26/Feedback/!">feedback system</a>).</p>
