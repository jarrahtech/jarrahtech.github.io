        <p><p>Concealed Intent will leave Early Access and become fully released to
Steam on <strong>Tuesday 2 August 3pm GMT</strong> (8am Pacific Time &amp; 11pm where I
am in Malaysia) - here is the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">store
link</a>. The original plan was
to release a week later, but it appears a little game called No Man’s
Sky is released that day. It seemed best to go a week early. I’ll need
to get going on marketing quickly.</p>

<p>Also, if you enjoy the game, writing a positive Steam review is hugely
useful. I would be greatly appreciative, please consider it.</p>

blog</a></em></p>

<p>I have set up a new website: <a href="http://www.agamedevplays.com/">A Gamedev
Plays…</a> will be dedicated to
discussion and reviews of all sorts of games (but mostly games that I
want to play). There is already an associated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a> and
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/agamedevplays">Steam group</a>. I will be
using the Jarrah Technology
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/JarrahTech">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook</a> pages for
promotional purposes at the moment.</p>

<p>The plan for the new site is to play more games and write about them,
both as a game design learning exercise and as motivation to create more
myself. As a secondary goal, I also hope to create a small community
around my games writing.</p>

<p>There is an explosion of game making at the moment. More and more games,
many with innovative ideas are being released. I need to be aware of
what is happening in game design. Since starting work on my own games I
can’t help but try to analyse what makes a game work (or not!) when I
play it. Being able to organise these thoughts into a coherent argument
in a presentable form can only help me improve my future games.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>As my indie game nears a full release, my interest in indie marketing
increases. Recently I was on the <a href="https://www.spacegamejunkie.com/">Space Game
Junkie</a> podcast, and one of the hosts
mentioned that the <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com">Steamgifts</a> website had
not worked well for their sales effort. At that point I was planning on
including the site for marketing Concealed Intent’s full release. There
are a number of game giveaways on Steamgifts with messages stating they
are for marketing purposes, and a few people have contacted me asking
for keys to giveaway on the website (all refused, I can do it myself).
So I wondered, how useful is Steamgifts as a marketing channel? Not
finding any information online, I decided to try a few amateur
experiments just to see how it worked.</p>

<p>For those that don’t know, Steamgifts is a website where members can
give away copies of Steam (and only Steam) games. There are hundreds of
games given away each day. It is not designed as a site for game
marketing, but giveaway creators can include a short message, and these
are often explicitly advertising related (for a game, or group, or
YouTube channel, etc). The winner is chosen at random among those
members of the site who have chosen to enter. Members are restricted in
the number of giveaways they can enter, and must have at least $100
worth of games on their Steam account (so it is hard to enter a giveaway
multiple times). There are currently a <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/XaCbA/list-of-all-cv-levels-and-their-corresponding-real-cv">little over 900,000
members</a>,
of which around 135,000 have given away at least one game, and some many
more. If a giveaways is open to everyone for over a day it will usually
have 1000-2000 entries, depending on the game. Some very large giveaways
(50+ copies) or desirable games gather 10,000+ entries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/LttHx/concealed-intent">Here is an example of a
giveaway</a>
created for this experiment. The marketing text in the message is the
standard copy for my Steam Early Access game, Concealed Intent. A brief
description of the game, followed by a link and call-to-action, “please
wishlist the game” (I thought a “please buy” CTA might be overly
ambitious), then some social media links. The only way to enter the
competition is through this webpage. So theoretically everyone who
enters the giveaway should be exposed to the message.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/steamgifts_impressions.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do very little marketing for the game at the moment, because as a sole
developer I chose to spend most of my time on development tasks. This
will shift in the next few weeks as full release nears and I go nearly
full-time on marketing. However, during the experiment, I did no other
marketing so views on the Steam store page are at a low and baseline
level. Above is a graph of the store page impressions according to
Steam, the grey line is total visits. Can you see the giveaways’ effect?
There are 8 giveaways through this period, each separated by at least a
day. The two most successful giveaways ended on the 11th May &amp; 17th May.
On those days there is a noticeable jump in direct visits to the store
page (the light blue line).</p>

<p>Let’s see the raw numbers for Concealed Intent giveaways. I made two
giveaways, each for a few days, a week apart. Both giveaways spanned the
same days of the week. The number of visitors from Steamgifts to the
Steam store page is measured through Google Analytics (which I suspect
under counts visits slightly), and the number of extra wishlist entries
is taken from Steam after subtracting the baseline growth in the week
before I started the giveaways (1.5 per day).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Entries</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Comments</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">890</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">6</td>

      <td style="text-align: center">11</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>7.9%</strong></td>

      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>4.6%</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>0.8%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I believe this CTR compares very favourably with other advertising.
However, it must be considered that the cost of each giveaway is a copy
of Concealed Intent, with a retail price of US$15, making those clicks
extremely expensive by traditional measures. Although, that is only the
case if the winner was going to buy the game at full price (or at all),
probably unlikely given current indie game sales. Both winners did
immediately redeem the game and play, which makes me happy. There were
no extra sales in during the giveaway period, but I did gain a couple of
Twitter followers (of course I can’t be sure they came from Steamgifts).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that rise in the number of entries for the
second giveaway corresponds with a drop in CTR. Perhaps the second
giveaway included many people already aware of the game from the first
giveaway. In any case, there may be diminishing returns on repeated
giveaways. Thus they didn’t need to pay much attention to the text or
visit the store a second time. I suspect a third giveaway would be even
lower.</p>

<p>Prior to giving away my own game, I also tried giving different games
for which I had keys leftover from bundle purchases, all with the same
Concealed Intent marketing message attached. The *’ed rows indicate
multiple overlapping giveaways with aggregated statistics.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here the CTR is much lower. So low in fact I think that errors in
counting visits or random changes in non-Steamgifts wishlisting will
greatly skew the figures. Basically, giving away other people’s bundled
game does not have much effect (although of course using bundled games
means there is not much expense either). I would suggest relatively few
people read the message, and most of the clicks are from checking out
the game actually being given away before entering (rather than for the
game in the marketing copy - makes sense to me).</p>

<p>So giving away my game on Steamgifts netted me at least 117 views of my
Steam Store page and onto 19 extra wishlists for a cost between 0 -
US$30. Other marketing opportunities available to indiedevs are:
self-promotion on social media; asking web magazines and YouTubers for
coverage; or paying hard cash for advertising. Given this, I would
consider using Steamgifts giveaways again - just to increase awareness
of the game. Although in small numbers (1 at a time), spaced with larger
time gaps between them (at least a week), and only until awareness of
the game reaches some as yet undefined level.</p>

<p>It is left as an exercise for a reader to measure the marketing
effectiveness of giving away 50+ copies at once. I am not brave enough
to try it with my game (at least not yet).</p>

<p>I am very interested to hear other people’s experiences or comments.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I linked this post in the Steamgifts forum and an
interesting discussion ensued over the value of 50+ giveaways or
restricting entry to more engaged members. <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/oC2fe/steamgifts-for-marketing">Here it
is</a>,
worth a read if you found this interesting.</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-07-09</em> - Hi Anton, I agree that using the full retail value of the game is not completely valid, although I disagree there is no cost at all. There is an opportunity cost, but it will be much smaller than the retail, as it would only be the case if the person winning the game would buy the game anyway. So the cost per giveaway will be somewhere between 0 &amp; US$15. I just don’t know where. the full retail is a handy maximum. Other numbers would be US$11.04 (the average amount paid including discounts and foreign currencies), US$10 (the last sale price), about US$6 (what I get per average copy after Steam &amp; tax). The likelihood (so far) of someone buying after going to the game’s store page is around 1 in 10000 (and about 1 in 1000 for wishlisting, so hopefully the sales will improve after full release). On that basis the value per view is less than a cent! Now I’ve worked that all out, it is a bit depressing. I just had another check of the Steam backend and I can’t find the number of follows the game has. Sales, wishlists and views are all very clear, but I can’t see follows. Doesn’t mean they are not there somewhere, I’ll keep looking. Sounds like you have some nice friends :)</p>

<p><em>unknown @ 2016-07-09</em> - comment deleted</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-07-11</em> - It is a grey area :) Steam rules say I can’t give out the financials. I think I’m probably safe given that. To work out Steam’s cut from the above you would need to know my tax rate, refund rate and chargeback rate, plus the exact amount. So it is not obvious. Then again details of Steam’s cut is not hard to find - Cliffski (much bigger dev than me) put it on his blog just this weekend (<a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/07/09/why-valve-should-give-jobs-to-journalists/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/07/09/why-valve-should-give-jobs-to-journalists/">http://positech.co.uk/cliff…</a> ) and Garry Newman put up his sales &amp; refund rates (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276450/Rust_Garrys_Mod_dev_shares_data_on_refund_rates.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276450/Rust_Garrys_Mod_dev_shares_data_on_refund_rates.php">http://www.gamasutra.com/vi…</a> ). So if that is ok, I think my vague numbers are ok :)</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>I’ve just gotten the neutral unknowns system working in Concealed
Intent. This is where all ships that have not yet been categorised are
displayed as neutrals in yellow (unless the neutral colour has been
modified). Upon categorisation, ships are shown with their real
identification code and colour.</p>

<p><a href="https://gfycat.com/SelfreliantIdolizedArcticseal"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/neutral_unknowns.gif" alt="Unknown neutral ships are identified as enemies." title="Unknown neutral ships are identified as enemies." /></a></p>

<p>Going back to the <a href="/2016/03/22/Plan-Out-EA/">plan out of early access</a>,
this is the last of the features mentioned for the release version. In a
week or so, after testing, the next version (#30) will have 2 new
skirmish modes: <strong>savior</strong>, where the player has to keep civilian
shuttles safe, as well as defeat the enemy; and, <strong>waves</strong>, with endless
waves of enemies spawning until the player’s base is destroyed (but the
player’s ships regenerate until then). Savior mode will always include
the neutral unknown system, so the player is not sure if a ship is
friend-or-foe until they are identified. In other skirmish types the
neutral system is not very useful (as all unknown ships must be enemies,
at least at first) so it will be turned off. Previous versions of
Concealed Intent saw updated campaign and tutorial missions, plus the
multi-monitor fix.</p>

<p>Thus Concealed Intent is now feature complete, at least as far as its
release is concerned.</p>

<p>Not to say there is nothing left to do! There is of course the list of
ongoing tasks. After next week’s version there will be at least one more
containing just tweaks and bugfixes - this will be the release candidate
(aiming for mid-June).</p>

<p>Ongoing work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bugfixes</li>
  <li>Minor mission improvements</li>
  <li>Improvements to Skirmish “Hard AI”</li>
</ul>

<p>After that there are no planned updates, but if a bug appears I’ll put
out a fix. It also means the plan towards a release sometime in August
is still on track (yay!). Thus marketing will start to take an
increasing large percentage of my time. After the release other tasks
will be considered, but no promises.</p>

<p>Possible features for after release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-Steam non-DRM version</li>
  <li>Linux version</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
</ul>

work out when to fully release the game.</p>

<p>One thing that has become clear during Early Access is that if a solo
game developer tries to do development and marketing at the same time,
then both are done poorly. So the current plan is to at some point to
declare Concealed Intent ready for release. Then wait between a
fortnight and a month, just testing and checking there are no bugs or
spelling mistakes (also preparing marketing materials). Then spend a
month on just marketing before the actual release. During this two month
period no new features will be added to the game, only the smallest
changes will be considered and then only if necessary.</p>

<p>The other thing to consider when planning a release date is the Steam
Summer Sale. I don’t know when it will be this year (yet), but the last
two years it has been a fortnight in June. When that event is running
any game launch will be swamped and disappear in the hype. Concealed
Intent’s two week launch window must not overlap with that sale.</p>

<p>Combine all that and if Concealed Intent is to launch before the Steam
Summer Sale then I need to stop right now and start the bug checking
phase. I don’t want to do that. I planned to complete a couple of
iterations on the campaign work, but I have only completed one so far.
Unfortunately I have been sick (probably the flu) and this has cost me
nearly a fortnight’s worth of work. Work I still want to complete. So in
the end the decision is easy (thanks to being ill), Concealed Intent
will be released after the Steam Summer Sale.</p>

<p>So what does that mean? Assuming that the sale is in June, I will
consider that the bug check month, and July the marketing month. Thus
the aim is to release Concealed Intent in early August. If the sale is
in July, then I may push the release back a little. Fingers crossed it
is June (and no other problems/issues arise).</p>

<p>On that basis I have until the end of May to continue working on
Concealed Intent features. Although I’m not going to be working
full-time on the game. Firstly, I’m about to go on a holiday, as my
girlfriend has taken to the expanded timeline and corresponding decrease
in pressure to declare its time for a break. I agree with her, there is
no risk of losing dev momentum at the moment as being sick has sent me
back to zero in that regard anyway. After the break I also need to start
thinking about what to do after Concealed Intent. So to that end I will
taking a week or two out of the plan to create prototypes when possible.
That should still leave enough time for two or three Concealed Intent
releases. My task list will be:</p>

<p>Ongoing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bugfixes</li>
  <li>Campaign improvements</li>
  <li>Improvements to Skirmish “Hard AI”</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible New Work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handle multiple monitors (this is difficult as I only have a single
monitor, but it will likely require updating the libraries used by the
game and that part can be done in preparation for a proper fix. The
update may also help with other reported issues.)</li>
  <li>Neutral system in skirmishes (like in online games, unknown ships are
displayed as neutrals until identified - this will probably be a
modifier)</li>
  <li>Extra objective scenarios in Skirmishes</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlikely Features (maybe for after release):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linux version</li>
  <li>Non-Steam non-DRM version</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s the plan. Hopefully I can stick to this one (all the others
turned out to be overly optimistic). So I’ll be back soon and initially
working on another pass of the campaign. Comments welcome!!</p>

        <p><p><em>This article was first <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2016/01/what-next.html">posted on my personal
blog</a></em></p>

<p>It has been a couple of months since releasing <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed Intent onto
Steam Early Access</a> it is
time to assess how things have gone and plan for the future.</p>

<p>While I’m quite happy with Concealed Intent as a game, financially it
has been a disappointment. Largely this is my own fault. As a sole
developer I must make a choice between developing or marketing. I have
overwhelming chosen dev work over the last 2 months. Still the sales
have still resulted in a few people playing it and providing feedback.
It has highlighted a some bugs and issues, most of which are now fixed.
Early Access has also given me a focus - single player skirmishes seem
to be more highly desired than online play (lucky because there are not
enough players to form a decent online community right now). This is
immensely useful information. Previously the game was trying to be a bit
of everything in the hope of attracting the attention of a potential
purchaser. Now it will be mainly single-player, where skirmish is the
main game, but there is a also basic online play so you can challenge
your friends.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/new_skirmish.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/new_skirmish_thumb.png" alt="Skirmish Configuration" title="Skirmish Configuration" /></a></p>

<p>Under this vision, the way forward to release is clear. Procedural
skirmish must be expanded with an AI that can provide some challenge.
The single-player campaign can be shortened but needs to more engaging
while subtlety teaching the game. Online play is largely done, only bug
fixes and performance enhancements remain.</p>

<p>So that is the plan to finish Concealed Intent. Skirmish improvements,
then AI improvements, then mission work, then… done? At least in the
sense of a proper “release”, yes it will be done. The majority of my
time after that point will be spent on developing other games. There
will still be a few things to do Linux support, non-Steam online
support, other little improvements and of course bug fixes as required.</p>

<p>Right now I’ve nearly finished a first pass at the Skirmish
improvements. If it was not for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org">GGJ16</a> I’d
release it this weekend. Instead it will be available early next week
(so I’m around if there is a problem). I hope to have a final version
with improved AI by mid-Feb. Then I foresee a couple more fortnightly
versions iterating on the campaign and improving skirmish &amp; AI as
issues/ideas arise. However, that will not be the end. As previously
stated, I have to choose between development and marketing. Since I have
a couple of months of dev work, I will continue mainly with that for
now. However, when the above task list is complete it will be time to
switch. Thus the plan is to finish the dev work, wait at least a week to
ensure there are no bad bugs, then start a 30 day release countdown
where I spend a few hours per day solely on marketing. Then the release,
followed by another week of marketing. Then just see.</p>

<p>One thing I don’t expect to see is a flood of sales. I hope to have
enough sales to cover my costs and provide enough money for a future
game. The feedback received so far is generally positive, but not “indie
breakout hit” positive. I will likely struggle for media coverage and
sales amongst a horde of other indie games. One advantage I have is that
my situation is unchanged, there is not much I could be doing other than
creating games. I have another 15 months before reality returns. Thus I
can create another game with my hard-won lessons from Concealed Intent.
In fact since the main lesson learnt is to make much smaller games,
hopefully I can make more than one. Ideal would be a couple of short (3
month dev work) games made with an artist willing to profit-share (to
keep upfront costs down). I have collected a few such small ideas and it
is time to start creating prototypes to check if they are worth
pursuing. By mid-Feb I hope to be spending about 10-20% of my time on
this task - a pipeline of work must be established to take over from
Concealed Intent as it requires less time (not counting marketing of
course!). Otherwise there will be no chance of continuing gamedev as a
profession long-term.</p>

<p>The other main lesson is that marketing is hard. Very hard. There are a
large number of people out to get keys for “reviews”, but very few can
deliver and those asking are almost always the smaller media outlets.
The larger ones are probably swamped with review requests. Getting
noticed is difficult. During the release-30 countdown I’ll do my best to
let people know Concealed Intent exists. Although I’ve also been
considering trying to become the media. Sure, I have a couple of rarely
viewed blogs (like this one), but viewing some the of key requesters’
outlets made me wonder if I could try that too. Basically an attempt to
build a community around games in general, not specifically my games.
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won’t (check back here to find out!). I
have a few ideas on how to make things a little different to others, now
I just need to check the time requirements. There will probably be one
video just to experiment.</p>

<p>Hmm, still so much to do and so many possibilities. But first to GGJ16…</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed Intent is 33% off</a>
as part of the Steam Winter sale until the 4th January.</p>

<p>It has been just over a month since Concealed Intent’s release onto
Steam Early Access. Sales have been lower than expected, but then my
marketing has been lacking in effort more than expected too, so there is
no basis for complaint. My time instead has been spent on improving the
game - with definite results. The initial EA release was version 0.9.16.
Today I released 0.9.20. Tons of (minor) bugs are fixed and many
cosmetic improvements made. Furthermore, on entering EA, there were 4
features that needed to be completed before a full release: 4 new
missions; Steam Achievements; a focus point for online duels; and, being
able to challenge your friends online.</p>

<p>With the 0.9.20 release, all the original goals for EA are now complete!
This release specifically adds the ability to challenge a friend on
Steam. Players can also choose the ship type, the map and the time limit
for submitting turns (defaults to 7 days, but can range from 30 minutes
to 30 days). Hopefully this will fix the previous problems of online
match-making and a few duels will get started. It is also a large change
to the underlying code base - it has been a busy month.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_menu.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_menu.png" width="400" alt="" /></a>
<a href="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_action.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_action.png" width="400" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Does this mean I’m done and ready for a full release? Definitely not.
Apart from the inevitable bug fixes, there are a few more things to be
done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Skirmish features - the most requested feature among the community
is more detailed skirmishes. So , this will be the major piece of
work addressed next. Part of it it will be fairly straightforward,
but the implications of those changes to the AI will be the real
challenge. The enemies will have to get a lot smarter to handle all
the options, at the moment they would just become confused.</li>
  <li>UI &amp; UX improvements - there are a few inconsistencies and
annoyances - these should be ironed out.</li>
  <li>Performance - I’ve noticed a few skipped frames on my (5 year old)
PC. This shouldn’t happen and I will find and fix the problem.</li>
  <li>Missions and tutorial rework (plus balance) - Watching people play
suggests that the early missions are still problematic - either too
easy or too hard. Need to spend some more time on this.</li>
  <li>Marketing - really should get going on this task!!!</li>
</ul>

<p>But all that will have to wait a little, as apart from a few marketing
tasks (and assuming the latest release doesn’t have a breaking bug) I’m
taking the rest of the year off. My first break since May.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It’s alive. I mean it is live. This morning I set Concealed Intent to
“published” on Steam Early Access. As the page informing me of success
suggested: “insert confetti here”. If you go to the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">Steam Store
page</a> or the big Steam widget
on the <a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">games webpage</a> it is possible to
pay actual real money for it. It feels very weird that people might do
so (not many though after just a couple of hours:).</p>

<p>Of course, the game is not finished. Not by a long way. This is more of
a start than an end. Hopefully the feedback more players will provide
will help make the game better. Already I have seen a number of good
suggestions (from prerelease copies) - and no bugs yet!</p>

<p>There are four things I really want to get done before release (but
Steam says not to promise anything, so these are not promises!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 extra single-player campaign missions</li>
  <li>Steam achievements</li>
  <li>A focus point for online duels to prevent two stealth players never
finding each other</li>
  <li>Being able to challenge your Steam friends to a game with custom time
limits, rather than random match-making with whomever is online, which
is probably no one :(</li>
</ul>

<p>After those four I’ll hopefully have time to add more features as
prioritised by the community.</p>

<p>There have also been a couple of YouTube Let’s Play videos posted.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=limV-arFiRA">Negative Root - Sneak Peek Concealed
Intent</a> (English) - first 5
missions</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9QFj8qpZUI">Daraton - FIRST LOOK OF The Concealed
Intent</a> (Deutsch|German) -
tutorial and first two introductory missions</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of YouTube and prerelease copies. As mentioned in the previous
post, I’m getting a ton of key requests. Strangely, today is the first
day I haven’t woken up to 10+ key requests. On average I refuse 80-90%.
Usually because: a large number of keys are requested; the email address
is unverifiable; the requester has no videos in the last month; I don’t
see any similar games reviewed; or, they have very few views (I look for
around 80-100+ views on videos a few weeks old). I’m not sure if any of
this is normal, but in the Steam discussion groups many gamedevs seem
regretful of profligate key giveaways. However, I’m still checking all
of them taking 5-10 minutes each.</p>

<p>That adds up. With all the other little unexpected release tasks, the
time allotted to development has greatly suffered in the last week. I’ve
probably only managed the equivalent of two previous workdays progress
over the last 8 days.</p>

<p>Oh, and one last pro tip. Upload your game music to YouTube as private
videos well before your release date, to ensure people without any
rights haven’t somehow managed to “claim” your music! This happened to
me and wrecked my weekend as YouTuber’s will not post videos of games so
encumbered. Lucky, it is all fixed now and the copyright is back where
it belongs.</p>

<p>Now back to emails and hopefully some dev work too. And definitely not
hitting refresh button on the sales report, no, no, no…</p>

        <p><p>It is time to bite the bullet and set a release date:</p>

<p><strong>19 <sup>th</sup> November 2015</strong></p>

<p>On that day Concealed Intent with be released onto Steam Early Access.
The price will be US$14.99 (or whatever Steam converts that into for
your local currency), but there will be a 20% discount for the first
week. Note that Early Access does not meant the game is finished. Quite
the opposite, it means that work is ongoing and that I hope that players
will help me by leaving feedback - especially on game balance.</p>

<p>I’ve also kept up a background marketing task, I now have more places on
the web details on the game can be found. So many it is getting hard to
keep track of them all! Anyway here are the new ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">Steam Store Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dodistribute.com/access/KkO7lRlDYp/">Do Distribute()</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://madewith.unity.com/games/concealed-intent">Made With Unity</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I have already discovered about releasing a game, is that you
are immediately deluged with people asking for free copies, usually in
return for a review. I don’t mind this, but it does take some time to go
through them and ensure they are genuine. Unfortunately most cannot be
confirmed, and with the scourge of key resellers ever present, I am
hesitant to give a key (or multiple keys as is usually requested). My
advice to people requesting keys is firstly, make it clear and easily
checked you are who you say you are. Secondly, ask for a single key
unless you have a good (and explicit stated) reason for more.</p>
