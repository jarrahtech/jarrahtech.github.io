        <p><p><em>This article was first <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2016/01/what-next.html">posted on my personal
blog</a></em></p>

<p>It has been a couple of months since releasing <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed Intent onto
Steam Early Access</a> it is
time to assess how things have gone and plan for the future.</p>

<p>While I’m quite happy with Concealed Intent as a game, financially it
has been a disappointment. Largely this is my own fault. As a sole
developer I must make a choice between developing or marketing. I have
overwhelming chosen dev work over the last 2 months. Still the sales
have still resulted in a few people playing it and providing feedback.
It has highlighted a some bugs and issues, most of which are now fixed.
Early Access has also given me a focus - single player skirmishes seem
to be more highly desired than online play (lucky because there are not
enough players to form a decent online community right now). This is
immensely useful information. Previously the game was trying to be a bit
of everything in the hope of attracting the attention of a potential
purchaser. Now it will be mainly single-player, where skirmish is the
main game, but there is a also basic online play so you can challenge
your friends.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/new_skirmish.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/new_skirmish_thumb.png" alt="Skirmish Configuration" title="Skirmish Configuration" /></a></p>

<p>Under this vision, the way forward to release is clear. Procedural
skirmish must be expanded with an AI that can provide some challenge.
The single-player campaign can be shortened but needs to more engaging
while subtlety teaching the game. Online play is largely done, only bug
fixes and performance enhancements remain.</p>

<p>So that is the plan to finish Concealed Intent. Skirmish improvements,
then AI improvements, then mission work, then… done? At least in the
sense of a proper “release”, yes it will be done. The majority of my
time after that point will be spent on developing other games. There
will still be a few things to do Linux support, non-Steam online
support, other little improvements and of course bug fixes as required.</p>

<p>Right now I’ve nearly finished a first pass at the Skirmish
improvements. If it was not for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org">GGJ16</a> I’d
release it this weekend. Instead it will be available early next week
(so I’m around if there is a problem). I hope to have a final version
with improved AI by mid-Feb. Then I foresee a couple more fortnightly
versions iterating on the campaign and improving skirmish &amp; AI as
issues/ideas arise. However, that will not be the end. As previously
stated, I have to choose between development and marketing. Since I have
a couple of months of dev work, I will continue mainly with that for
now. However, when the above task list is complete it will be time to
switch. Thus the plan is to finish the dev work, wait at least a week to
ensure there are no bad bugs, then start a 30 day release countdown
where I spend a few hours per day solely on marketing. Then the release,
followed by another week of marketing. Then just see.</p>

<p>One thing I don’t expect to see is a flood of sales. I hope to have
enough sales to cover my costs and provide enough money for a future
game. The feedback received so far is generally positive, but not “indie
breakout hit” positive. I will likely struggle for media coverage and
sales amongst a horde of other indie games. One advantage I have is that
my situation is unchanged, there is not much I could be doing other than
creating games. I have another 15 months before reality returns. Thus I
can create another game with my hard-won lessons from Concealed Intent.
In fact since the main lesson learnt is to make much smaller games,
hopefully I can make more than one. Ideal would be a couple of short (3
month dev work) games made with an artist willing to profit-share (to
keep upfront costs down). I have collected a few such small ideas and it
is time to start creating prototypes to check if they are worth
pursuing. By mid-Feb I hope to be spending about 10-20% of my time on
this task - a pipeline of work must be established to take over from
Concealed Intent as it requires less time (not counting marketing of
course!). Otherwise there will be no chance of continuing gamedev as a
profession long-term.</p>

<p>The other main lesson is that marketing is hard. Very hard. There are a
large number of people out to get keys for “reviews”, but very few can
deliver and those asking are almost always the smaller media outlets.
The larger ones are probably swamped with review requests. Getting
noticed is difficult. During the release-30 countdown I’ll do my best to
let people know Concealed Intent exists. Although I’ve also been
considering trying to become the media. Sure, I have a couple of rarely
viewed blogs (like this one), but viewing some the of key requesters’
outlets made me wonder if I could try that too. Basically an attempt to
build a community around games in general, not specifically my games.
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won’t (check back here to find out!). I
have a few ideas on how to make things a little different to others, now
I just need to check the time requirements. There will probably be one
video just to experiment.</p>

<p>Hmm, still so much to do and so many possibilities. But first to GGJ16…</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed Intent is 33% off</a>
as part of the Steam Winter sale until the 4th January.</p>

<p>It has been just over a month since Concealed Intent’s release onto
Steam Early Access. Sales have been lower than expected, but then my
marketing has been lacking in effort more than expected too, so there is
no basis for complaint. My time instead has been spent on improving the
game - with definite results. The initial EA release was version 0.9.16.
Today I released 0.9.20. Tons of (minor) bugs are fixed and many
cosmetic improvements made. Furthermore, on entering EA, there were 4
features that needed to be completed before a full release: 4 new
missions; Steam Achievements; a focus point for online duels; and, being
able to challenge your friends online.</p>

<p>With the 0.9.20 release, all the original goals for EA are now complete!
This release specifically adds the ability to challenge a friend on
Steam. Players can also choose the ship type, the map and the time limit
for submitting turns (defaults to 7 days, but can range from 30 minutes
to 30 days). Hopefully this will fix the previous problems of online
match-making and a few duels will get started. It is also a large change
to the underlying code base - it has been a busy month.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_menu.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_menu.png" width="400" alt="" /></a>
<a href="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_action.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_action.png" width="400" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Does this mean I’m done and ready for a full release? Definitely not.
Apart from the inevitable bug fixes, there are a few more things to be
done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Skirmish features - the most requested feature among the community
is more detailed skirmishes. So , this will be the major piece of
work addressed next. Part of it it will be fairly straightforward,
but the implications of those changes to the AI will be the real
challenge. The enemies will have to get a lot smarter to handle all
the options, at the moment they would just become confused.</li>
  <li>UI &amp; UX improvements - there are a few inconsistencies and
annoyances - these should be ironed out.</li>
  <li>Performance - I’ve noticed a few skipped frames on my (5 year old)
PC. This shouldn’t happen and I will find and fix the problem.</li>
  <li>Missions and tutorial rework (plus balance) - Watching people play
suggests that the early missions are still problematic - either too
easy or too hard. Need to spend some more time on this.</li>
  <li>Marketing - really should get going on this task!!!</li>
</ul>

<p>But all that will have to wait a little, as apart from a few marketing
tasks (and assuming the latest release doesn’t have a breaking bug) I’m
taking the rest of the year off. My first break since May.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It’s alive. I mean it is live. This morning I set Concealed Intent to
“published” on Steam Early Access. As the page informing me of success
suggested: “insert confetti here”. If you go to the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">Steam Store
page</a> or the big Steam widget
on the <a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">games webpage</a> it is possible to
pay actual real money for it. It feels very weird that people might do
so (not many though after just a couple of hours:).</p>

<p>Of course, the game is not finished. Not by a long way. This is more of
a start than an end. Hopefully the feedback more players will provide
will help make the game better. Already I have seen a number of good
suggestions (from prerelease copies) - and no bugs yet!</p>

<p>There are four things I really want to get done before release (but
Steam says not to promise anything, so these are not promises!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 extra single-player campaign missions</li>
  <li>Steam achievements</li>
  <li>A focus point for online duels to prevent two stealth players never
finding each other</li>
  <li>Being able to challenge your Steam friends to a game with custom time
limits, rather than random match-making with whomever is online, which
is probably no one :(</li>
</ul>

<p>After those four I’ll hopefully have time to add more features as
prioritised by the community.</p>

<p>There have also been a couple of YouTube Let’s Play videos posted.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=limV-arFiRA">Negative Root - Sneak Peek Concealed
Intent</a> (English) - first 5
missions</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9QFj8qpZUI">Daraton - FIRST LOOK OF The Concealed
Intent</a> (Deutsch|German) -
tutorial and first two introductory missions</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of YouTube and prerelease copies. As mentioned in the previous
post, I’m getting a ton of key requests. Strangely, today is the first
day I haven’t woken up to 10+ key requests. On average I refuse 80-90%.
Usually because: a large number of keys are requested; the email address
is unverifiable; the requester has no videos in the last month; I don’t
see any similar games reviewed; or, they have very few views (I look for
around 80-100+ views on videos a few weeks old). I’m not sure if any of
this is normal, but in the Steam discussion groups many gamedevs seem
regretful of profligate key giveaways. However, I’m still checking all
of them taking 5-10 minutes each.</p>

<p>That adds up. With all the other little unexpected release tasks, the
time allotted to development has greatly suffered in the last week. I’ve
probably only managed the equivalent of two previous workdays progress
over the last 8 days.</p>

<p>Oh, and one last pro tip. Upload your game music to YouTube as private
videos well before your release date, to ensure people without any
rights haven’t somehow managed to “claim” your music! This happened to
me and wrecked my weekend as YouTuber’s will not post videos of games so
encumbered. Lucky, it is all fixed now and the copyright is back where
it belongs.</p>

<p>Now back to emails and hopefully some dev work too. And definitely not
hitting refresh button on the sales report, no, no, no…</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It is time to bite the bullet and set a release date:</p>

<p><strong>19 <sup>th</sup> November 2015</strong></p>

<p>On that day Concealed Intent with be released onto Steam Early Access.
The price will be US$14.99 (or whatever Steam converts that into for
your local currency), but there will be a 20% discount for the first
week. Note that Early Access does not meant the game is finished. Quite
the opposite, it means that work is ongoing and that I hope that players
will help me by leaving feedback - especially on game balance.</p>

<p>I’ve also kept up a background marketing task, I now have more places on
the web details on the game can be found. So many it is getting hard to
keep track of them all! Anyway here are the new ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">Steam Store Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://dodistribute.com/access/KkO7lRlDYp/">Do Distribute()</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://madewith.unity.com/games/concealed-intent">Made With Unity</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I have already discovered about releasing a game, is that you
are immediately deluged with people asking for free copies, usually in
return for a review. I don’t mind this, but it does take some time to go
through them and ensure they are genuine. Unfortunately most cannot be
confirmed, and with the scourge of key resellers ever present, I am
hesitant to give a key (or multiple keys as is usually requested). My
advice to people requesting keys is firstly, make it clear and easily
checked you are who you say you are. Secondly, ask for a single key
unless you have a good (and explicit stated) reason for more.</p>

        <p><p>Creating an indie game is never just a matter of writing code (I wish!).
There is also always some marketing - even the <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf
Fortress</a> people spend some time
telling the world about their game. Concealed Intent is no exception. I
may not find it easy or enjoyable, but it needs to be done. So for the
last 5 days no work on the game itself has been completed. Instead I
have created trailers, screenshots and copy. Next up is more
mission/balance/AI work (am I sounding like a stuck record?).</p>

        <p><p>It has been a while since I last updated everyone on Concealed Intent’s
progress. This is not because little has been happening - quite the
opposite! I have been working so much almost everything else has fallen
away - most notably exercise and keeping up with people. In the last
week I’ve left the house twice, both times just to buy food. It is
crunch time on the project, but since this is a one-person project, I’m
doing it to myself and have no one else to blame. However, today a major
goal was “finished” (in quotes as it is never really finished), so I
have a little downtime. Partly this is because Unity has said they may
release fix for a bug that has plagued me the last fortnight, and I
decided to wait a little for it before releasing the latest build. There
is a workaround for the bug, but that has its own issues. So here’s
hoping that they do fix it and soon!</p>

<p>Since the start of September more online functionality, a soundtrack, a
modular narrative system, random skirmish generation, a splash screen
and various bug fixes have been added to the game. However, the biggest
change is to the controls, GUI and tutorial. By mid September, I was
feeling quite confident in the quality of Concealed Intent and began
planning to put it on Steam. First there was to be the final playtests.
Unfortunately, those playtests did not go well. The general view was
that it was hard to tell what was going on in the tute, the game broke
certain conventions and there was just too much clicking. Oh well. I was
in quite the funk for a few days afterwards, wondering if the game was a
failure. Recovery came through talking to a couple of local gamedevs
(thanks guys!) and now the GUI has greatly changed - movement and
targeting can be done with a single click, sub panels (noise, components
&amp; log) have been removed, the tutorial completely rewritten and a
selection indicator added.</p>

<p>Now once again I think the game is ready for Steam Early Access. If its
not, I’ll probably just release it anyway because I can’t keep working
on this game forever. It must end soon. There is the “workaround”
version on dropbox now (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">available
here</a>).
hopefully to be replaced with the fixed version soon. Then it is time to
put this version out for comments. Then I’ll work to get a private beta
on Steam (sending keys to all those that have helped along the way),
while at the same time improving my (nearly non-existent) marketing
materials - including this website.</p>

        <p><p>So <a href="/2015/07/18/The-Best-Laid-Plans/">my last post</a> (some time ago!)
plotted out a path to finishing (or at least Steam Early Access). Who
spotted the obvious error in the plan? If you said “two weeks to finish
an online server is a little ambitious”, then congratulations you are
absolutely correct.</p>

<p>It is now a fortnight past when I hoped to have such a server completed,
and it is only just usable. Players can register, search for duels, and
play a game. They can even concede the game if they wish. There are no
outstanding bugs, but there is still more to do. The last “must do” item
is adding timers to the turns so a player can’t just abandon a game
leaving their opponent hanging. Other than that there are a few things I
should add, but can wait until later, including: a coop mode; bots if no
player opponents are available; player ranking systems with better
match-making; Steam user auto-registration; and, many performance
improvements (at the moment my home PC can probably support about a
hundred simultaneous games).</p>

<p>As it is not completely done, this release will be skipped, it will not
be available on the Dropbox folder. Instead 0.9.12 will be an internal
release and now I’ll start on 0.9.13 as the final alpha release
available before heading onto Early Access. Of course I’m already two
weeks behind, so now the goal is for a mid-September release, and
October for getting on Steam. The main tasks are fixing up the narrative
messages, adding a soundtrack, adding more missions, AI improvements,
Steam integration and of course those damn turn timers!</p>

        <p><p>When is Concealed Intent “done”? This is something I’ve been thinking
about since being <a href="/2015/05/30/How-To-Get-Greenlight/">Greenlit</a>. It
would be very easy for me to just keep going forever, aiming for a level
of perfection that can never be achieved. Alternatively, I could just
stop and give up. At various times during development, both these
possibilities have appealed. However, the goal for Concealed Intent is
for it to be financially successful enough to warrant creating another
game. Although the idea of taking someone’s money for Concealed Intent
scares me immensely, it is essential if I’m to continue, so I’ll aim for
the best game I can (in order not to disappoint paying customers), that
can be finished soon’ish (2.5 years is long enough).</p>

<p>There are two pages of “todo &amp; wishlist” items on my workdesk. Not all
can be done in a reasonable time period. A balance needs to be found.
Now is the time to boil them down to the things absolutely necessary for
wider release. Then fit them into a (hopefully) fortnightly release
schedule.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>17th July</strong> - v0.9.10: Final set of ship components, new
“right-click to move to …” system, and get online prototype working
again.</li>
  <li><strong>31st July</strong> - v0.9.11: Rework some parts of GUI, like the stats
panel and loadout screens.</li>
  <li><strong>14th August</strong> - v0.9.12: 1v1 online play and supporting screens.</li>
  <li><strong>28th August</strong> - v0.9.13: Steam integration, 3 extra missions and
some AI rework.</li>
  <li><strong>?? September</strong> - Profit! (or at least, Steam Early Access!)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few other significant changes on the todo list which I won’t
do until after reaching Early Access. There are also a number of
unmentioned small issues that will be done around the larger items on
this plan.</p>

<p>Observant readers will notice these plans start with a release
yesterday. Behold! <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">It can be downloaded
here</a>.
So far, so good. Below is an image of the old stats panel (to be updated
next) with the new components. Can you work out what they do? They are
the 5 icons underneath “Sensors/Weapons”, although they are neither
sensors or weapons - that text will change.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/new_components.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/new_components.png" width="600" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In the leadup to getting on Steam, I’ll have to start marketing again
and reaching out to people. One of the benefits of being Greenlit was I
could let marketing slide for a while and focus on finishing Concealed
Intent. Soon, I’ll have to go back to time-intensive PR activities and
consequently dev work will slow again. Another reason to get these major
items off the todo list. The addition of online play and extra missions
will mean the original vision for Concealed Intent will be complete. The
only extra “nice to have” functionality will be full modding support.
However, that will take far too long and so have to wait for a future
update - if the game is successful.</p>

<p>Better get back to development!</p>

        <p><p>Part of indie game development is letting people know about your game.
Luckily there are a number of channels that exist to amplify your
message to a willing audience. One of these is Screenshot Saturday on
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturday">Twitter</a>,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/search?q=flair%3ASSS&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on">Reddit</a>,
and <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=24094.0">TIGForums</a>.
Concealed Intent has made occasional appearances on these, but less than
it should. I usually start thinking about images to post on Saturday
morning and often just run out of time to get it done before Sunday
rolls around (although that doesn’t seem to stop some people).</p>

<p>This time I am prepared. I have been aiming for a weekly tempo of <a href="/2015/06/12/Demo/">demo
pre-alpha releases</a> and been hitting my deadlines,
until last week. From now on I’ll aim for fortnightly releases. Work to
improve the performance of Concealed Intent and its graphics at the same
time as upgrading the Unity engine took too long - especially testing.
It is done now, and the extra week means there is some time for
screenshots! Click on them for larger versions.</p>

<p>This first image below is my favourite. It shows the planning phase
towards the end of the “Extraction” mission. The player is attempting to
escape the enemy’s greater firepower (especially that station) by using
their drone as a decoy. Thus the players corvette is deploying
countermeasures to stay as unnoticeable as possible. Meanwhile the
doomed drone is doing the opposite - flying into the mass of red enemy
contacts with active sensors blazing. The video is what happened after
clicking “Action” - not bad, most of the enemy ships fired on the drone,
but two mines fired (and missed) the corvette.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/screenshots_20150626/decoy_run.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/screenshots_20150626/decoy_run_preview.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Here are some other game screenshots I captured. They are (clockwise
from top-left): a battle in an asteroid field; trying to persuade some
potential allies and getting shot in return; the campaign menu screen;
and, targeting an enemy drone. Want to see for yourself? A pre-alpha
test version of Concealed Intent can be <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">downloaded from dropbox
