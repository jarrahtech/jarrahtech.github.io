        <p><p>Creating Concealed Intent has largely been a solo endeavour. This is
against all the advice the web has to offer. It appears to be generally
accepted that it is best to get as much testing and prototype feedback
as possible. Playing the Concealed Intent test builds, I can see the
need a great deal of additional work. I had ideas for improvements, but
I wasn’t sure the best way forward. I’m very close to the game so find
it hard to imagine how other people would play it.</p>

<p>It needed another point of view. A fresh pair of eyes. Luckily a
workmate turned out to enjoy playing strategy games and recently offered
give it a go. This was the first great benefit of the testing process. I
had to turn my raggedy game that played more like a set of unit tests
into something that could be fun (or at least give the impression it
could be fun with more work). The result could charitably be called a
pre-alpha release. Many bugs were squashed and from a player’s point of
view it improved quickly, but it was still clumsy to control and there
wasn’t much to do.</p>

        <p><p>Space is big. Really big. Also, it is very empty. Big and empty - so how
can Concealed Intent be about stealth?</p>

<p>The idea is that while space is big and empty, your enemy is a long way
from you. Opponents 30,000km apart would be considered in close combat
and certainly too close for most stealth abilities to be successful.
First contact with the enemy will be at ranges of 1 lightsecond (the
distance light travels in 1 second - 300,000 km) or further. Your enemy
is small, far away and moving fast. To your benefit they are also frail
and have nowhere to hide. Of course, the same situation applies to you.</p>

<p>At these distances and with ships travelling at significant fractions of
the speed of light (10-30%), the key to winning a battle is determining
exactly where your opponent is and firing first. Various sensors and
drones assist detection. Acting to reduce the amount of noise (heat,
radar, gravity disturbance) emanating from your ship make it harder to
be detected. Also breaking line-of-sight by flying behind planets or
moons will hinder detection - for both you and your opponent. In the end
it is a tradeoff between actions that help detection of other ships but
also aid in others detecting you.</p>

<p>Like most space combat games, Concealed Intent takes some inspiration
from naval warfare. For an interesting discussion of common space combat
inaccuracies in games and movies that a look at <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/28/aircraft_carriers_in_space">this Foreign Policy
article</a>.
In this case the influence is submarine warfare. Before becoming
Concealed Intent, the game had the working title SpaceSub. Imagine if
there were only submarines (no surface ships or aircraft). It would all
come down to detection - who could evade detection and who could quickly
detect others. That is my aim.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/news/tag/Kickstarter.html">Kickstarter</a>
    
  <br/>
        <p><p>When I talk to people about Concealed Intent, one of the most common
responses is “Are you going to do a
”KickStarter“:http://www.kickstarter.com/?”. The answer is “no, or at
least not for a while”.</p>

<p>KickStarter is a great idea and has received a great deal of press in
gaming circles recently. It allows developers to basically presell their
game (or other project - it is not just games) and get the money in
advance of actually finishing. The benefit for the backers is the warm
fuzzy feeling of supporting Indie games and usually a copy of the game,
sometimes with extra paraphernalia (posters, t-shirts, etc). There are
concerns too, some people point out there is no guarantee any backed
project will deliver - the money could disappear. Despite this
KickStarter has hundreds of games raising money right now. <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/kickstarter-katchup/">Rock, Paper,
Shotgun</a> even
do a regular roundup of projects. There have been some huge success:
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/66710809/double-fine-adventure">Double
Fine</a>
raised over $3 million; <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">Wasteland
2</a> raised just
under $3 million (and it will be written using Unity3D); and as I write
this <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">Project
Eternity</a>
(to which I have contributed) has raised over $1 million in 24 hours
with 31 more days to go.</p>

<p>So why wouldn’t I jump on the bandwagon? Basically because I don’t need
the money right now and it would be a distraction. The successful
KickStarters put in a great deal of effort to impress potential backers
and raise awareness. I have no significant history or background in the
gaming industry and Concealed Intent is at a very early stage of
development. Time is better spent improving the game than creating
videos to sell it. Luckily, Jarrah Technology was a consulting company
in a previous incarnation and retained profits can fund development for
some time (especially considering my very low expenses!).</p>

<p>As Concealed Intent approaches completion the situation may change.
Artwork and music will need to be acquired externally. The quality and
quantity of this media will be driven directly by how much I’m prepared
to pay. A little extra money at this stage could go a long way. A
KickStarter then may be beneficial. I could use the near-completed game
as evidence it will be completed and the backers will receive their
rewards. It could also be good PR - letting people know the graphics
will be professionally produced. However, that is at least over a year
away, so don’t look for Concealed Intent on KickStarter anytime soon.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>The last couple of days I have struggling with frame stuttering or
skipping in Unity3D. It seems that movement in my game would
occasionally miss a frame or not update properly. It transpires that it
is not Unity causing the problem, instead seems to be caused by a vsync
mismatch between Windows and the video card.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing">Vsync</a> is a system built
into monitors to prevent screen tearing. A monitor updates the image it
displays at a set rate - 60 times a second (hertz) for my monitor.
However computers may prepare frames for display at a greater rate and
if the computer updates the frame to display in the middle of the
monitor displaying a frame then what is actually shown may be a mix of
the two. This is screen tearing. Many games allow their framerate to be
locked to monitor refresh rate to prevent tearing - this is vsync.</p>

<p>It seems Windows 7 also uses vsync to prevent tearing with its display.
For some reason Windows uses a refresh rate of 59 hertz and I can’t seem
to change it. This seems to cause a 1 frame per second mismatch, about
the same rate of stutter observed. There are people with people with
similar problems on the Unity forums
<a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/137924-Stuttering-with-vSync">here</a>
and
<a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/142754-linear-movement-stuttering">here</a>
(and others, but the important information is just repeated).</p>

<p>I couldn’t find a way to change the monitor’s vsync rate. Instead I
tried <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-QualitySettings.html">turning off vsync in
Unity</a>
and with my slower mac with vsync - both resulted in the problem
disappearing. Thus, I am fairly sure that the issue is not in my (still
quite simple) Unity game. Although, there is some talk that this
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/gaming/5397-they-need-fix-asap-aero-vsync.html">doesn’t happen in fullscreen
mode</a>,
but when I tried fullscreen it still occurred.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how to completely fix this. With vsync turned off my game
runs at around 4000 fps on my development machine, so there is little
chance of tearing, but no guarantee other people will be as lucky.
Anyone have any ideas?</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>I’m back from the three day <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a> Unity3D
conference in Amsterdam. I have put my notes from the sessions up at my
personal blog. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/08/unite12-day-1.html">Day One is
here</a> and the
other days are linked from there.</p>

<p>Overall, the conference was a good experience and worth the trip. Going
certainly engendered a sense that Unity3D is a safe choice for game
development. There was a surprisingly large number of attendees. Also
some big name games were produced using the tool, including the AAA and
well-reviewed <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/endless-space">Endless
Space</a> - a game not
entirely disimilar to Concealed Intent. The demos of Unity4 looked
particularly impressive. I don’t think a small Unity developer like me
need to overly worry about performance as the tool is obviously plenty
fast enough. I learnt a great deal from the talks, often leaving
inspired and wishing I had my full development environment available to
start coding immediately. In particular, Concealed Intent may soon have
camera movement very similar to <a href="http://universesandbox.com/">Universe
Sandbox</a>, make use of structs for memory
management and I now see a need to learn more about custom shaders
(everyone’s doing it).</p>

<p>I also had my eyes opened to the business side of game development. I
perhaps went to the conference too early for maximum business benefit,
but then I didn’t know that until attending. It is best to go to a
conference with a purpose and a message. That could be finding a
publisher, advertising for contract work or just making connections. I
just went to see what was happening and perhaps appeared as a
dilletante, just trying out game development for fun. That is not the
situation, but disproving it requires finishing Concealed Intent (or at
least getting very close to finishing).</p>

<p>Onward!</p>

<a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a>, the conference for
<a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/">Unity3D</a>. Well, I’m going - so that is 100%
of Jarrah Technology. If you’re there, I’d be interested in chatting
about all things Unity related and beyond.</p>

<p>In my six months using Unity I’ve become very impressed with it.
However, I know I’m still learning and lean heavily on my background in
programming to write Unity scripts to achieve my aims. Often I later
discover an easier way built into the tool itself. Meeting up with other
Unity developers and seeing what they do can only be beneficial. I go to
the London Unity User Group meetings and they have been great, so
hopefully this conference will be even better. I’m getting excited.</p>

        <p><p>Rewriting software projects is bad and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">almost never the best
option</a>.
However, Concealed Intent is currently being rewritten.</p>

<p>Work on Concealed Intent began properly at the beginning of May after a
couple of small proof-of-concepts developed on a part-time basis. Since
then, most effort has been spent investigating how to implement the core
idea and learning the <a href="http://www.unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> library. As a
result the code became messy as ideas were added then removed and
sometimes added back again. It was becoming increasingly harder to
progress.</p>

<p>Now there is a much clearer idea of what Concealed Intent should look
like. Thus, the project was restarted on August 5th and is moving
forward at a nice rate. The earlier effort was not wasted, it is really
a large prototype. Future posts will examine some of the work done in
this prototype as a teaser for the full version coming soon. In the
meantime, here is an early screenshot showing a player’s modular
corvette and two drones rounding a small planet to close on 3 unknown
enemy ships.</p>

        <p><p>The name of Jarrah Technology’s first game will be <strong>Concealed Intent</strong>.
It is a turn-based tactical stealth space combat game, inspired by
titles like <a href="http://www.frozensynapse.com/">Frozen Synapse</a> and
<a href="http://www.relic.com/games/homeworld/">Homeworld</a>.</p>

<p>In space combat you know that your enemies are out there, but not
exactly where they are or what they are. To defeat them you need to
devise a range of strategies to gain enough information to successfully
shoot. All the while your enemies are trying to do the same to you.
Various equipment is available to help both sides, including sensors and
drones. The game includes a single-player campaign, an instant skirmish
generator and multiplayer options.</p>
