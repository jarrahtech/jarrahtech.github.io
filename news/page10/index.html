  <br/>
        <p><p>It has been nearly 5 weeks since my last update. This corresponds to 5
weeks since an alpha build was sent out for testing and 5 weeks since
any development work on Concealed Intent. So what has been happening?
There has been the wait for feedback from testers and much thinking
about future work. I have also been replaying Frozen Synapse (one of the
inspirations for Concealed Intent) and other turn-based games.</p>

<p>Based on feedback and fresher memories of Frozen Synapse, I think it is
time to go in a different direction. Frozen Synapse is more complex and
frustrating than I remember (though it is still a good game). Adding the
3rd dimension and a “fog of war” mechanic to the mix has made Concealed
Intent too complex. The plan is now to make the game’s core mechanics
simpler. Stealth and 3D are essential to the concept, so they will stay.
Instead, targeting then firing when a certain hit probability is
exceeded will be replaced by ships shooting on explicit command. The
ability to rewind/replay will also be removed. Just these two changes
will make the internal simulation far simpler and should address the big
issues raised by testers. There will be a number of other smaller
changes too, including a reorganisation of the GUI. The result is
hopefully a more intuitive playing experience.</p>

<p>The testing experience has not gone as I expected. The alpha build was
only sent to people who had said, in person, they would like to test the
game. Despite this I was prepared to consider a response rate of around
40% as a huge success (defining response as saying that they at least
played it). The actual response rate barely breaks into two digits and
has taken far longer than hoped. I’d like to believe this is because
people have been too busy to try the game out. However, I suspect a few
people played it and didn’t like it, and so decided not to respond
(despite that sort of feedback being vital). Next time a build is ready
for some testing I definitely won’t try the same system again, but I’m
not sure how to replace.</p>

        <p><p>Work has been progressing slowly, but steadily on Concealed Intent.
Regular goals are set to puncuatate development and in the last few days
the Alpha4 goal has been reached. This goal calls for the game to be
minimally playable. So now people need to try playing it.</p>

<p>This is scary stuff. Up to now only three people have seen the work in
progress. Now there will be a small audience judging it and offering
feedback. All I can see are the rough edges of “developer art”,
awkardness of the controls and stupidity of the AI enemies. I hope they
enjoy it!</p>

<p>Concealed Intent has never been a hobby. The intention has always been
to finish and sell it. I could keep improving it forever, but feedback
is needed if there is ever to be a final release. As I’m so close to it
I know exactly how to play, barely notice the GUI, and know all the
controls by muscle memory. I expect others to play it in different ways
and to spot the things previously overlooked. Hopefully they will also
provide insight or suggestions on current features. Silence would be the
worst outcome.</p>

<p>If you would like to join the testers, just drop me an email.</p>

        <p><p>Recently I came across <a href="http://alexcpeterson.com/spacescape">Alex Patterson’s
Spacescape</a> program. It creates
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox_(video_games)">space skyboxes</a> by
building up layers of stars, billboards (special stars, galaxies or
other external images) and noise (for gas and nebulae). These can then
be exported as a standard 6 skybox images each up to 4096x4096
resolution. All this under the permissive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT
License</a>. Definitely worth
checking out if you are developing a space-based project.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/skybox.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This could be very useful in Concealed Intent. However, there are a
couple of issues to be noted when importing the resulting images into a
Unity skybox. For more details see the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/Textures.html">Unity Texture
documentation</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Spacescape and Unity use opposite conventions for left and right
skybox images - put the left Spacescape image in Unity’s right
skybox slot and vice-versa.</li>
  <li>All images should have their wrap mode set to clamp in Unity.
Otherwise the seams between images will be visible.</li>
  <li>The default max texture size for Unity is often set to 1024 (at
least it was for me). If Spacescape has produced images at higher
quality be sure to update Unity to get the full resolution image.</li>

        <p><p>Writing a game by yourself is hard. Harder than I thought when I
started. Obviously, everything needs to be done by a single person, or
outsourced. The game’s scope needs to be kept realistic and that means
fairly small. I aimed small when starting, but in retrospect I should
have aimed even smaller. This means that progress can be slow and, as a
non-artist, it is easy to see all the things can’t do well. Sometimes
motivation can be an issue.</p>

<p>The past week has seen the extremes experienced. At the start of the
week there were many bugs and the game obviously had no polish. I
thought I would never get it to work. A week later and the bugs are all
fixed, at least the known ones! The goals for the 3rd alpha release have
been reached and it is clear there has been forward movement. I was also
surprised by the AI as my computer opponent surrounded me - how cool!</p>

<p>With this alpha release it is time to start working towards a wider
audience. At the moment there is just a couple of people seeing my work.
Motivation to do the work will be easier if more people are playing a
test version - assuming they don’t completely trash the concept. So
Alpha4 will be a complete player-vs-computer scenario version of the
game (campaign and multiplayer will come later). If it is all fine, it
should be quickly followed by a very similar beta version to show to as
many people as possible.</p>

<p>It may be a case of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">sunken cost
fallacy</a>, but I just have to
keep going. Oh, and remember to do a smaller game next time!</p>

Hence the lack of posts over the last month. I lost about three weeks

        <p><p>Work on improving the camera control in Concealed Intent is largely
complete. At least until testers make new suggestions. It is now much
easier to navigate around the 3D playing space in a scenario. <a href="/2013/03/27/Zoom_Scale/">Replacing
scale with zoom</a> is one of the changes, now
with added tweening between zoom states. Another big change is the
addition of a map mode - as shown below.</p>

        <p><p>The last couple of weeks of Concealed Intent development have been
focused on improving the way players move the camera around the 3D
playing space. Part of this magnifying the view or seeing more of the
whole scene - the same affect as zooming/unzooming with a camera lens.
This is a fairly standard mechanism in strategy games and there are
couple of ways to implement it. I am coming to the conclusion I picked a
very bad way to do it.</p>

        <p><p>As Concealed Intent is a 3D game with objects free to move in any
direction, development often throws up interesting 3D geometry problems
(see old problems
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/collinearity-in-unity3d.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/03/line-plane-intersection-in-uni.html">here</a>).
The latest problem was testing to see if an object is partially visible,
or rather, if something is slightly blocking the view. Imagine that you
have a spaceship and you want to know not only if it is visible on the
screen, but also if a part of it is behind a planet or another ship.</p>

        <p><p>It’s been a slow couple of weeks in Concealed Intent development. At the
moment I’m working on cleaning up some longstanding kludges in the code.
I generally plan on doing this sort of maintenance and refactoring at
the start of a new dev cycle. Indeed, I have just started work towards
Alpha3.</p>

<p>There was a rush to get the second alpha finished before a short holiday
at the end of February. The target date was hit with all planned
functionality complete. However, I’m not happy with the result. All the
features are there, but it doesn’t work well as a whole and is less
pretty than before. This is due partly to old problems being exposed by
new features and partly because the new features do not work well
together. There are many new GUI components and game balance still off.
To some degree, I was expecting this.</p>

<p>After feedback from the first alpha, I wanted to try out various ideas
and see what worked. That was the plan for Alpha2. However, it is still
disappointing when test playthroughs are actually more annoying then
previously. I have to pass through this disheartening phase and continue
working. To this end I have constructed a task list for Alpha3. Most of
the task descriptions start with words like “improve” or “better”. There
are very few new features - the aim is that Alpha3 will be enjoyably
playable.</p>

<p>For the next release, I may not set a specific date and list of tasks.
Instead there will just be a list of tasks. I’ll keep going until the
result works well as a whole. Working to a date means may not have time
to get it all working nicely, or being a bit uncomfortable taking on
large tasks in case they’re not done in time.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Concealed Intent is about stealth, or at least that is the aim (the
current build needs more work on balance). But how can you be stealthy
in space? Well, space is <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2012/10/02/Space_Is_Big/">big and
empty</a> . Thus
finding something can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. On the
other hand, there is nowhere for the needle to hide - to stay hidden it
needs to fade into the background as much as possible.</p>

<p>How easily a ship can be detected is determined by the amount of noise
it produces. Here noise is not sound - there are no sound waves
transmitted across the vacuum of space. Instead, it is anything the ship
may do that signals its presence. A big ship may blot out stars as it
passes; heat from engines can be detected against the cold of the void;
and, lasers can be tracked back to their origin. Nearly anything a ship
can do will also increase the ability of those around to detect it.</p>

<p>On this basis, noise in Concealed Intent is distance. The more noise a
ship produces, the further away it can be detected. Over time, more
information about the detected ship is discovered as the level of
detection increases. Eventually a firing solution can be calculated so
that a beam of coherent light a few millimeters in diameter can cross
thousands of kilometers to strike an evasive enemy. Although all these
actions only make the detecting ship more easily detected!</p>

<p>This is the core gameplay mechanic in Concealed Intent. Using drones,
probes, mines and decoys to detect your enemies with the minimum of
action so that they can’t detect you.</p>
