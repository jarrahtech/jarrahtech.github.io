        <p><p>Another long gap between updates. I haven’t give up - there will be a
completed version of Concealed Intent! Just today I renewed the
concealedintent.com domain for another year - how is that for
commitment. Work is continuing and the game is beginning to reach the
same level it was at before I sent out the alpha, and then started the
<a href="/2013/10/15/Not_Again/">rewrite</a>. I will endeavour to give more regular
updates in future. As part of my <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/02/goals-3.html">personal goals for the
year</a>, I have stated
the plan to post year at least once a month.</p>

<p>This is the point in time I had hoped to have a finished game. My target
was to complete, release and then go to the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer’s
Conference</a> in San Francisco. It starts next
week, and I’m not attending. Having been to a GameDev conference before
(<a href="/2012/09/01/Unite_Report/">Unite12</a>), I know that the most valuable
part is talking to the other participants. Learning from the talks is an
ancillary benefit. However, I also know going as someone who has never
worked in the industry or written a game is always a bit of an outsider.
Many of people want to make games, few do so. I need to complete
something to prove I can, before going to another conference.</p>

<p>Hopefully next year!</p>

        <p><p>Again a long gap between updates. This time as I struggle with making
changes to simplify Concealed Intent. I have tried to make small
modifications, but find small adjustments ripple through the system and
become bigger undertakings than expected. Forward progress was slow.
Thus I have started again - which I consider a <a href="/2012/08/06/Rewrite">failure of
sorts</a>. My only consolation is that now I have a
clearer understanding of what the resulting game will look like and
better knowledge of Unity3D. Hopefully the result will be much better.</p>

<p>Part of the problem with my old code is that it sometimes worked against
Unity’s normal flow. The result was more “server-like” as this is closer
to my previous professional experience. For example, the in this <a href="2013/02/07/Dev_Diary">Dev
Diary</a> I proudly demonstrated my Builder pattern
code for configuring a scenario. Now it is done the standard Unity way
and the objects in the scene are stored in the scene itself rather than
loaded from a data file (although that is still an option). Also I’m
working harder to keep to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a>
pattern. I tried this in the previous version too, but it became
somewhat corrupted as I struggled to get all the functionality working.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the viedo below on structuring large projects in Unity
was presented at the recent Unite13 conference (I did not attend this
year). They talk about how their mistakes must evoke schadenfreude in
the audience. Concealed Intent is much smaller than their project, but I
felt no schadenfreude - only recognition of the same issues I have
encountered.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It has been nearly 5 weeks since my last update. This corresponds to 5
weeks since an alpha build was sent out for testing and 5 weeks since
any development work on Concealed Intent. So what has been happening?
There has been the wait for feedback from testers and much thinking
about future work. I have also been replaying Frozen Synapse (one of the
inspirations for Concealed Intent) and other turn-based games.</p>

<p>Based on feedback and fresher memories of Frozen Synapse, I think it is
time to go in a different direction. Frozen Synapse is more complex and
frustrating than I remember (though it is still a good game). Adding the
3rd dimension and a “fog of war” mechanic to the mix has made Concealed
Intent too complex. The plan is now to make the game’s core mechanics
simpler. Stealth and 3D are essential to the concept, so they will stay.
Instead, targeting then firing when a certain hit probability is
exceeded will be replaced by ships shooting on explicit command. The
ability to rewind/replay will also be removed. Just these two changes
will make the internal simulation far simpler and should address the big
issues raised by testers. There will be a number of other smaller
changes too, including a reorganisation of the GUI. The result is
hopefully a more intuitive playing experience.</p>

<p>The testing experience has not gone as I expected. The alpha build was
only sent to people who had said, in person, they would like to test the
game. Despite this I was prepared to consider a response rate of around
40% as a huge success (defining response as saying that they at least
played it). The actual response rate barely breaks into two digits and
has taken far longer than hoped. I’d like to believe this is because
people have been too busy to try the game out. However, I suspect a few
people played it and didn’t like it, and so decided not to respond
(despite that sort of feedback being vital). Next time a build is ready
for some testing I definitely won’t try the same system again, but I’m
not sure how to replace.</p>

        <p><p>Work has been progressing slowly, but steadily on Concealed Intent.
Regular goals are set to puncuatate development and in the last few days
the Alpha4 goal has been reached. This goal calls for the game to be
minimally playable. So now people need to try playing it.</p>

<p>This is scary stuff. Up to now only three people have seen the work in
progress. Now there will be a small audience judging it and offering
feedback. All I can see are the rough edges of “developer art”,
awkardness of the controls and stupidity of the AI enemies. I hope they
enjoy it!</p>

<p>Concealed Intent has never been a hobby. The intention has always been
to finish and sell it. I could keep improving it forever, but feedback
is needed if there is ever to be a final release. As I’m so close to it
I know exactly how to play, barely notice the GUI, and know all the
controls by muscle memory. I expect others to play it in different ways
and to spot the things previously overlooked. Hopefully they will also
provide insight or suggestions on current features. Silence would be the
worst outcome.</p>

<p>If you would like to join the testers, just drop me an email.</p>

        <p><p>Recently I came across <a href="http://alexcpeterson.com/spacescape">Alex Patterson’s
Spacescape</a> program. It creates
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox_(video_games)">space skyboxes</a> by
building up layers of stars, billboards (special stars, galaxies or
other external images) and noise (for gas and nebulae). These can then
be exported as a standard 6 skybox images each up to 4096x4096
resolution. All this under the permissive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT
License</a>. Definitely worth
checking out if you are developing a space-based project.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/skybox.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This could be very useful in Concealed Intent. However, there are a
couple of issues to be noted when importing the resulting images into a
Unity skybox. For more details see the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/Textures.html">Unity Texture
documentation</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Spacescape and Unity use opposite conventions for left and right
skybox images - put the left Spacescape image in Unity’s right
skybox slot and vice-versa.</li>
  <li>All images should have their wrap mode set to clamp in Unity.
Otherwise the seams between images will be visible.</li>
  <li>The default max texture size for Unity is often set to 1024 (at
least it was for me). If Spacescape has produced images at higher
quality be sure to update Unity to get the full resolution image.</li>

        <p><p>Writing a game by yourself is hard. Harder than I thought when I
started. Obviously, everything needs to be done by a single person, or
outsourced. The game’s scope needs to be kept realistic and that means
fairly small. I aimed small when starting, but in retrospect I should
have aimed even smaller. This means that progress can be slow and, as a
non-artist, it is easy to see all the things can’t do well. Sometimes
motivation can be an issue.</p>

<p>The past week has seen the extremes experienced. At the start of the
week there were many bugs and the game obviously had no polish. I
thought I would never get it to work. A week later and the bugs are all
fixed, at least the known ones! The goals for the 3rd alpha release have
been reached and it is clear there has been forward movement. I was also
surprised by the AI as my computer opponent surrounded me - how cool!</p>

<p>With this alpha release it is time to start working towards a wider
audience. At the moment there is just a couple of people seeing my work.
Motivation to do the work will be easier if more people are playing a
test version - assuming they don’t completely trash the concept. So
Alpha4 will be a complete player-vs-computer scenario version of the
game (campaign and multiplayer will come later). If it is all fine, it
should be quickly followed by a very similar beta version to show to as
many people as possible.</p>

<p>It may be a case of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">sunken cost
fallacy</a>, but I just have to
keep going. Oh, and remember to do a smaller game next time!</p>

Hence the lack of posts over the last month. I lost about three weeks

complete. At least until testers make new suggestions. It is now much
easier to navigate around the 3D playing space in a scenario. <a href="/2013/03/27/Zoom_Scale/">Replacing
scale with zoom</a> is one of the changes, now

        <p><p>The last couple of weeks of Concealed Intent development have been
focused on improving the way players move the camera around the 3D
playing space. Part of this magnifying the view or seeing more of the
whole scene - the same affect as zooming/unzooming with a camera lens.
This is a fairly standard mechanism in strategy games and there are
couple of ways to implement it. I am coming to the conclusion I picked a
very bad way to do it.</p>

        <p><p>As Concealed Intent is a 3D game with objects free to move in any
direction, development often throws up interesting 3D geometry problems
(see old problems
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/collinearity-in-unity3d.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/03/line-plane-intersection-in-uni.html">here</a>).
The latest problem was testing to see if an object is partially visible,
or rather, if something is slightly blocking the view. Imagine that you
have a spaceship and you want to know not only if it is visible on the
screen, but also if a part of it is behind a planet or another ship.</p>
