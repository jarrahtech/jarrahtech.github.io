        <p><p>Done. Concealed Intent is now fully released. No longer is it marked
with the stigma of Early Access.</p>

<p>For the next week there is a 34% launch discount on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Steam</a>, and now for the
first time it is also available on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/concealed-intent">Humble
Store</a> too (same
discount).</p>

<p>The success of a modern games tends to be determined in their first
month of release. Visibility, reviews and sales now will result in more
visibility, reviews and sales later. So I’m not too proud to beg… If you
enjoy the game please consider telling people about it and/or writing a
review on Steam. It will all help. Also, if you do see something wrong
in the game, please let me know, the quicker I can find and fix any
issues the better.</p>

<p>Right now I’m also incredibly busy trying to get the word out and
responding to people’s messages. I am way behind. One of the more
interesting things I’m doing is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/4vvrpa/my_game_was_released_today_on_steam_after_years/">Reddit
AMA</a>.
Come along and ask me anything? Everyone who comments (with a question
or otherwise) by Friday 5th August 10:00am GMT will go into the running
to win one of 10 copies of Concealed Intent.</p>

<p>Development work is not over, there will still at least be a version 1.1
update at some point. However, I think the largest part of game is now
complete. Reaching a standard I felt happy about and then saying that
people can pay for it without that Early Access caveat is a huge step.</p>

<p>Having said all that, I would also like to give a huge thank you to
everyone who played Concealed Intent, purchased it, wishlisted/followed
it, or even just checked it out. This game could not have been finished
to this level (or even at all) without your support and feedback. Thank
you!</p>

        <p><p><em>“People wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long
hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition
in event of success.”</em></p>

<p>Paraphrasing Shakleton’s recruiting notice for Antarctic exploration
works surprisingly well for indiedevs too.</p>

<p>Today is the culmination (but not termination) of nearly four years of
effort. My game, Concealed Intent, is now out of Early Access and fully
released on Steam. It has easily been the largest project I have ever
undertaken and required intense effort to reach this point. Working
largely alone in a foreign country I often found myself questioning what
I was doing. However, in retrospect, I would still do it over again -
but with a few changes (see the “What went not so well” list below).</p>

<p>After a brief (and shameless) video interlude for Concealed Intent
itself, I will detail the things I think went right and not so well
during the development process. I have tried to think back to my state
of mind four years ago, just before starting and offer advice to that
naive and optimistic person. A later post, some time after the release,
will look at the business and financial side of the game - was it
profitable: stay tuned to find out!</p>

        <p><p>One of the game development tasks I have found particular difficult is
writing a good tutorial. Of course, best would be no tutorial at all.
Unfortunately, Concealed Intent is much too complex to be playable with
the player doing a little learning first - and that complexity is part
of the game’s design. Numerous hours have been spent tuning the
tutorial, but it is still a little clunky - probably the result of my
inexperience and the nature of the game. To help overcome this and the
common subtle misunderstandings, I have created a couple of videos to
help newbies. They will be added to the game page, the press kit and
maybe even as a link in the game itself.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/czbgsBdT-Bg">20 minute tutorial on how to
play:</a></p>

        <p><p>Concealed Intent will leave Early Access and become fully released to
Steam on <strong>Tuesday 2 August 3pm GMT</strong> (8am Pacific Time &amp; 11pm where I
am in Malaysia) - here is the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">store

to release a week later, but it appears a little game called No Man’s
Sky is released that day. It seemed best to go a week early. I’ll need
to get going on marketing quickly.</p>

<p>Also, if you enjoy the game, writing a positive Steam review is hugely
useful. I would be greatly appreciative, please consider it.</p>

blog</a></em></p>

<p>I have set up a new website: <a href="http://www.agamedevplays.com/">A Gamedev
Plays…</a> will be dedicated to
discussion and reviews of all sorts of games (but mostly games that I
want to play). There is already an associated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a> and
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/agamedevplays">Steam group</a>. I will be
using the Jarrah Technology
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/JarrahTech">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook</a> pages for
promotional purposes at the moment.</p>

<p>The plan for the new site is to play more games and write about them,
both as a game design learning exercise and as motivation to create more
myself. As a secondary goal, I also hope to create a small community
around my games writing.</p>

<p>There is an explosion of game making at the moment. More and more games,
many with innovative ideas are being released. I need to be aware of
what is happening in game design. Since starting work on my own games I
can’t help but try to analyse what makes a game work (or not!) when I
play it. Being able to organise these thoughts into a coherent argument
in a presentable form can only help me improve my future games.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>As my indie game nears a full release, my interest in indie marketing
increases. Recently I was on the <a href="https://www.spacegamejunkie.com/">Space Game
Junkie</a> podcast, and one of the hosts
mentioned that the <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com">Steamgifts</a> website had
not worked well for their sales effort. At that point I was planning on
including the site for marketing Concealed Intent’s full release. There
are a number of game giveaways on Steamgifts with messages stating they
are for marketing purposes, and a few people have contacted me asking
for keys to giveaway on the website (all refused, I can do it myself).
So I wondered, how useful is Steamgifts as a marketing channel? Not
finding any information online, I decided to try a few amateur
experiments just to see how it worked.</p>

<p>For those that don’t know, Steamgifts is a website where members can
give away copies of Steam (and only Steam) games. There are hundreds of
games given away each day. It is not designed as a site for game
marketing, but giveaway creators can include a short message, and these
are often explicitly advertising related (for a game, or group, or
YouTube channel, etc). The winner is chosen at random among those
members of the site who have chosen to enter. Members are restricted in
the number of giveaways they can enter, and must have at least $100
worth of games on their Steam account (so it is hard to enter a giveaway
multiple times). There are currently a <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/XaCbA/list-of-all-cv-levels-and-their-corresponding-real-cv">little over 900,000
members</a>,
of which around 135,000 have given away at least one game, and some many
more. If a giveaways is open to everyone for over a day it will usually
have 1000-2000 entries, depending on the game. Some very large giveaways
(50+ copies) or desirable games gather 10,000+ entries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/LttHx/concealed-intent">Here is an example of a
giveaway</a>
created for this experiment. The marketing text in the message is the
standard copy for my Steam Early Access game, Concealed Intent. A brief
description of the game, followed by a link and call-to-action, “please
wishlist the game” (I thought a “please buy” CTA might be overly
ambitious), then some social media links. The only way to enter the
competition is through this webpage. So theoretically everyone who
enters the giveaway should be exposed to the message.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/steamgifts_impressions.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do very little marketing for the game at the moment, because as a sole
developer I chose to spend most of my time on development tasks. This
will shift in the next few weeks as full release nears and I go nearly
full-time on marketing. However, during the experiment, I did no other
marketing so views on the Steam store page are at a low and baseline
level. Above is a graph of the store page impressions according to
Steam, the grey line is total visits. Can you see the giveaways’ effect?
There are 8 giveaways through this period, each separated by at least a
day. The two most successful giveaways ended on the 11th May &amp; 17th May.
On those days there is a noticeable jump in direct visits to the store
page (the light blue line).</p>

<p>Let’s see the raw numbers for Concealed Intent giveaways. I made two
giveaways, each for a few days, a week apart. Both giveaways spanned the
same days of the week. The number of visitors from Steamgifts to the
Steam store page is measured through Google Analytics (which I suspect
under counts visits slightly), and the number of extra wishlist entries
is taken from Steam after subtracting the baseline growth in the week
before I started the giveaways (1.5 per day).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Entries</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Comments</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Steam Visits</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Wishlist</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">CTR Visit</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">CTR +Wishlist</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">890</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">6</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">70</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">11</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>7.9%</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>1.2%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">1027</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">47</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">8</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>4.6%</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>0.8%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I believe this CTR compares very favourably with other advertising.
However, it must be considered that the cost of each giveaway is a copy
of Concealed Intent, with a retail price of US$15, making those clicks
extremely expensive by traditional measures. Although, that is only the
case if the winner was going to buy the game at full price (or at all),
probably unlikely given current indie game sales. Both winners did
immediately redeem the game and play, which makes me happy. There were
no extra sales in during the giveaway period, but I did gain a couple of
Twitter followers (of course I can’t be sure they came from Steamgifts).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that rise in the number of entries for the
second giveaway corresponds with a drop in CTR. Perhaps the second
giveaway included many people already aware of the game from the first
giveaway. In any case, there may be diminishing returns on repeated
giveaways. Thus they didn’t need to pay much attention to the text or
visit the store a second time. I suspect a third giveaway would be even
lower.</p>

<p>Prior to giving away my own game, I also tried giving different games
for which I had keys leftover from bundle purchases, all with the same
Concealed Intent marketing message attached. The *’ed rows indicate
multiple overlapping giveaways with aggregated statistics.</p>

<p>Here the CTR is much lower. So low in fact I think that errors in
counting visits or random changes in non-Steamgifts wishlisting will
greatly skew the figures. Basically, giving away other people’s bundled
game does not have much effect (although of course using bundled games
means there is not much expense either). I would suggest relatively few
people read the message, and most of the clicks are from checking out
the game actually being given away before entering (rather than for the
game in the marketing copy - makes sense to me).</p>

<p>So giving away my game on Steamgifts netted me at least 117 views of my
Steam Store page and onto 19 extra wishlists for a cost between 0 -
US$30. Other marketing opportunities available to indiedevs are:
self-promotion on social media; asking web magazines and YouTubers for
coverage; or paying hard cash for advertising. Given this, I would
consider using Steamgifts giveaways again - just to increase awareness
of the game. Although in small numbers (1 at a time), spaced with larger
time gaps between them (at least a week), and only until awareness of
the game reaches some as yet undefined level.</p>

<p>It is left as an exercise for a reader to measure the marketing
effectiveness of giving away 50+ copies at once. I am not brave enough
to try it with my game (at least not yet).</p>

<p>I am very interested to hear other people’s experiences or comments.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I linked this post in the Steamgifts forum and an
interesting discussion ensued over the value of 50+ giveaways or
restricting entry to more engaged members. <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/oC2fe/steamgifts-for-marketing">Here it
is</a>,
worth a read if you found this interesting.</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-07-09</em> - Hi Anton, I agree that using the full retail value of the game is not completely valid, although I disagree there is no cost at all. There is an opportunity cost, but it will be much smaller than the retail, as it would only be the case if the person winning the game would buy the game anyway. So the cost per giveaway will be somewhere between 0 &amp; US$15. I just don’t know where. the full retail is a handy maximum. Other numbers would be US$11.04 (the average amount paid including discounts and foreign currencies), US$10 (the last sale price), about US$6 (what I get per average copy after Steam &amp; tax). The likelihood (so far) of someone buying after going to the game’s store page is around 1 in 10000 (and about 1 in 1000 for wishlisting, so hopefully the sales will improve after full release). On that basis the value per view is less than a cent! Now I’ve worked that all out, it is a bit depressing. I just had another check of the Steam backend and I can’t find the number of follows the game has. Sales, wishlists and views are all very clear, but I can’t see follows. Doesn’t mean they are not there somewhere, I’ll keep looking. Sounds like you have some nice friends :)</p>

<p><em>unknown @ 2016-07-09</em> - comment deleted</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-07-11</em> - It is a grey area :) Steam rules say I can’t give out the financials. I think I’m probably safe given that. To work out Steam’s cut from the above you would need to know my tax rate, refund rate and chargeback rate, plus the exact amount. So it is not obvious. Then again details of Steam’s cut is not hard to find - Cliffski (much bigger dev than me) put it on his blog just this weekend (<a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/07/09/why-valve-should-give-jobs-to-journalists/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/07/09/why-valve-should-give-jobs-to-journalists/">http://positech.co.uk/cliff…</a> ) and Garry Newman put up his sales &amp; refund rates (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276450/Rust_Garrys_Mod_dev_shares_data_on_refund_rates.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276450/Rust_Garrys_Mod_dev_shares_data_on_refund_rates.php">http://www.gamasutra.com/vi…</a> ). So if that is ok, I think my vague numbers are ok :)</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>I’ve just gotten the neutral unknowns system working in Concealed
Intent. This is where all ships that have not yet been categorised are
displayed as neutrals in yellow (unless the neutral colour has been
modified). Upon categorisation, ships are shown with their real
identification code and colour.</p>

<p><a href="https://gfycat.com/SelfreliantIdolizedArcticseal"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/neutral_unknowns.gif" alt="Unknown neutral ships are identified as enemies." title="Unknown neutral ships are identified as enemies." /></a></p>

<p>Going back to the <a href="/2016/03/22/Plan-Out-EA/">plan out of early access</a>,
this is the last of the features mentioned for the release version. In a
week or so, after testing, the next version (#30) will have 2 new
skirmish modes: <strong>savior</strong>, where the player has to keep civilian
shuttles safe, as well as defeat the enemy; and, <strong>waves</strong>, with endless
waves of enemies spawning until the player’s base is destroyed (but the
player’s ships regenerate until then). Savior mode will always include
the neutral unknown system, so the player is not sure if a ship is
friend-or-foe until they are identified. In other skirmish types the
neutral system is not very useful (as all unknown ships must be enemies,
at least at first) so it will be turned off. Previous versions of
Concealed Intent saw updated campaign and tutorial missions, plus the
multi-monitor fix.</p>

<p>Thus Concealed Intent is now feature complete, at least as far as its
release is concerned.</p>

<p>Not to say there is nothing left to do! There is of course the list of
ongoing tasks. After next week’s version there will be at least one more
containing just tweaks and bugfixes - this will be the release candidate
(aiming for mid-June).</p>

<p>Ongoing work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bugfixes</li>
  <li>Minor mission improvements</li>
  <li>Improvements to Skirmish “Hard AI”</li>
</ul>

<p>After that there are no planned updates, but if a bug appears I’ll put
out a fix. It also means the plan towards a release sometime in August
is still on track (yay!). Thus marketing will start to take an
increasing large percentage of my time. After the release other tasks
will be considered, but no promises.</p>

<p>Possible features for after release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-Steam non-DRM version</li>
  <li>Linux version</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
</ul>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Looking at the Concealed Intent plan for Early Access, all the work
originally promised (plus a bit more) is complete. Now is the time to
work out when to fully release the game.</p>

<p>One thing that has become clear during Early Access is that if a solo
game developer tries to do development and marketing at the same time,
then both are done poorly. So the current plan is to at some point to
declare Concealed Intent ready for release. Then wait between a
fortnight and a month, just testing and checking there are no bugs or
spelling mistakes (also preparing marketing materials). Then spend a
month on just marketing before the actual release. During this two month
period no new features will be added to the game, only the smallest
changes will be considered and then only if necessary.</p>

<p>The other thing to consider when planning a release date is the Steam
Summer Sale. I don’t know when it will be this year (yet), but the last
two years it has been a fortnight in June. When that event is running
any game launch will be swamped and disappear in the hype. Concealed
Intent’s two week launch window must not overlap with that sale.</p>

<p>Combine all that and if Concealed Intent is to launch before the Steam
Summer Sale then I need to stop right now and start the bug checking
phase. I don’t want to do that. I planned to complete a couple of
iterations on the campaign work, but I have only completed one so far.
Unfortunately I have been sick (probably the flu) and this has cost me
nearly a fortnight’s worth of work. Work I still want to complete. So in
the end the decision is easy (thanks to being ill), Concealed Intent
will be released after the Steam Summer Sale.</p>

<p>So what does that mean? Assuming that the sale is in June, I will
consider that the bug check month, and July the marketing month. Thus
the aim is to release Concealed Intent in early August. If the sale is
in July, then I may push the release back a little. Fingers crossed it
is June (and no other problems/issues arise).</p>

<p>On that basis I have until the end of May to continue working on
Concealed Intent features. Although I’m not going to be working
full-time on the game. Firstly, I’m about to go on a holiday, as my
girlfriend has taken to the expanded timeline and corresponding decrease
in pressure to declare its time for a break. I agree with her, there is
no risk of losing dev momentum at the moment as being sick has sent me
back to zero in that regard anyway. After the break I also need to start
thinking about what to do after Concealed Intent. So to that end I will
taking a week or two out of the plan to create prototypes when possible.
That should still leave enough time for two or three Concealed Intent
releases. My task list will be:</p>

<p>Ongoing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bugfixes</li>
  <li>Campaign improvements</li>
  <li>Improvements to Skirmish “Hard AI”</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible New Work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handle multiple monitors (this is difficult as I only have a single
monitor, but it will likely require updating the libraries used by the
game and that part can be done in preparation for a proper fix. The
update may also help with other reported issues.)</li>
  <li>Neutral system in skirmishes (like in online games, unknown ships are
displayed as neutrals until identified - this will probably be a
modifier)</li>
  <li>Extra objective scenarios in Skirmishes</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlikely Features (maybe for after release):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linux version</li>
  <li>Non-Steam non-DRM version</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s the plan. Hopefully I can stick to this one (all the others
turned out to be overly optimistic). So I’ll be back soon and initially
working on another pass of the campaign. Comments welcome!!</p>
