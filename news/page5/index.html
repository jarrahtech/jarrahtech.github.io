        <p><p>Another 5 weeks done, but with slow progress. The plan was to have Abstract Hex Battle largely complete. It is not. There is a little more to do with progression mechanics, balance and animations. The plan now is to do all those plus the AI during this 5 week block. The delay is caused by a week of low productivity, another week given over to tax and other life problems, and more time than expected on the (hopefully) common tools. On the plus side I did manage to write the 3 blog posts (here is the first on <a href="/2020/08/11/Philosophy.html">The Philosophy of Jarrah Technology</a>).</p>

<p>Over the next 5 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstract Hex Battle should be complete. Including AI, full game progression mechanics &amp;  animations.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the 5 weeks after should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any last minute prettying up of the game and bugfixes.</li>
  <li>Release (probably to <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> initially)</li>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Now that I have <a href="/2020/04/06/Again.html">restarted Jarrah Technology</a>, I think it is important to set down some clear principles. Essentially a guiding philosophy on why I am a gamedev; how I want to proceed; and what sort of games I want to create. This should help when the inevitable difficult decisions need to be made, or at a minimum help prevent being side-tracked. I might as well make it public to keep me honest. This will be split into two parts: one with the fundamental ideas unlikely to change (presented here); and another post to derive the business model (which may change later).</p>

<p>To start - why become a gamedev? Mostly because it is something I enjoy and something I can do. I want to work for myself and create. Software development is my main skill, thus any plan will probably involve computers. There are paths other than games with similar results - I could work on startups or as an <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">indie hacker</a>. However, I have experience writing games. I know what is required. It is possible to do by myself if necessary. Importantly, I know I can enjoy the gamedev process. So I will start with games.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@kitfoxgames/8-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-starting-a-games-studio-e390a713a7d8">Creating a successful game studio</a> <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/KarlKontus/20200710/366187/Can_you_be_a_full_time_solo_indie_developer.php">is difficult</a> and often results in failure - even for those with profitable games. I want my games to make money (maybe even dream about it), but it is not the primary goal. I am lucky to be in a position where I don’t need much income for a while to live acceptably.  This means I will work on the games I want to work on, but at the same time will not try to work too much on a single title. I will aim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast">“fail-fast”</a>. This will hopefully maximise my chance at a hit (relatively) and maintain my attention. Still, in the end I must remember I am creating games first for myself, and secondly for a potential audience. I am not opposed to working in a team and/or publishers, as long as it fits in with this mindset (which I suspect would make it difficult).</p>

<p>What sort of game do I want to make? Basically, the sort of game I find myself returning to repeatedly. Games that present the player with <a href="http://www.wargamespace.com/2014/05/05/geryk-analysis-wargaming/">interesting choices</a>. I want players to be leaning forward and thinking. This means they are likely to be slower games - fast reactions will not be required and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actions_per_minute">actions-per-minute</a> will not be an important statistic.</p>

<p>Thus the genres I will focus on are: management games; simulation games; (computer) cardgames; (computer) boardgames; and, strategy/tactical games. Maybe with a little grand strategy and rogue-like in there too. Platformers, action games, adventure games, RPGs and FPS’s will be avoided. I will also be unlikely to work on puzzle games just out of personal preference, despite them fitting my requirements. The initial target is the PC single-player audience. Other platforms or play modes may come later. Definitely no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">F2P</a>. I’ll aim for 4-10 hours of gameplay, but with some replayability. I don’t want players to feel overwhelmed by the game. I would prefer to make an good impression then leave, rather than stretching the game too thinly.</p>

<p>I saw a video that suggested <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kg3NbqHrAU">“good players create strategies, average players see paths to victory, while weak players chase luck”</a>. On this measure, I foresee mainly developing for average players. It would be nice to move towards strategies, but I recognise the level of work to achieve this might be beyond my timeframe for each game. What does this mean? The games should have some component of luck resulting in variance of result, but the result should never be random - best is when the player can know what mistakes were made. I will try to avoid too much luck and aim for <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1294990/input-vs-output-randomness">output rather than input randomness</a> (where possible). The games are unlikely to be big in-depth simulations (war or otherwise). I will aim to simplify the complex. Some thought and strategy should be necessary to win regularly, but there should be no need to study.</p>

<p>Next, how I plan to make money, the <a href="/2020/09/23/Business-Model.html">Business Model</a>.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Work is progressing on prototypes. Report complete.</p>

<p>Ok, that is not enough. Several months ago I wrote that I had <a href="/2020/04/06/Again.html">restarted game development</a>. What has happened since then? Well, I have split my time into 5-week blocks, and have just finished the 3rd. It was at this point I had hoped to have the first prototype complete and released. However, as is always the case, things have taken longer than expected. I am now hoping to be finished and released in two more 5-week blocks. Although there is a potential problem with making that date - I suspect the AI will be harder than I had planned.</p>

<p>The game I decided to create is code-named “Abstract Hex Battle” - one of the tasks remaining is to come up with a better name! The idea was it should be a simple 2D game that I did not care too much about. Something that could serve as a way to test myself while creating  development tools and a routine. At the start, things went well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ahb/ahb_20200722.png" alt="Abstract Hex Battle WIP 20200722" title="Abstract Hex Battle WIP 20200722" /></p>

<p>It took just 4 weeks to get the basic game loop running. Then work slowed as I lost 3 of the last 11 weeks to non-gamedev work. I have also realised that despite being intentionally throwaway, I am not happy to release a game without some polish. So everything is taking longer than expected. This is something I will need to think about, as if I continue to polish my prototypes, then it is likely I will only be able to manage around 2 a year. At that point they are becoming more like little games than prototypes.</p>

<p>On the positive side, over the last couple of blocks I have created a number of (hopefully) reusable tools. That should make future games faster to develop. There are a couple more tools I think are required. Here is the plan.</p>

<p>Over the next 5 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstract Hex Battle should be complete except for AI. This means game progression mechanics &amp; unlocks; balance; animations; and common tools should be complete.</li>
  <li>Prepare 3 blog/mail articles on: the philosophy of Jarrah Technology Games; the business plan; and the road map.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the 5 weeks after should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a decent AI.</li>
  <li>Any last minute prettying up of the game and bugfixes.</li>
  <li>Release (probably to <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> initially)</li>
</ul>

<p>I will update again in 5 weeks.</p>

        <p><p>The world is in a state of flux, and so is my life. As of last week, I am no longer employed at Substantive Research. Also 6 months ago I moved back to my hometown: Perth, Australia. The plan is to take this opportunity to try creating games again. I started prototyping new ideas this Monday. These new games will be smaller than Concealed Intent, but still in the strategy/tactics genre, as that is what I enjoy. I do not plan on any future significant work on Concealed Intent. If there is a bug I will fix it, but otherwise that game is done.</p>

<p>In the next month or so, I plan to reactivate my communication channels (including this blog) and let people know what is happening properly.</p>

        <p><p>The Concealed Intent 1.3 release is out now! It is a few months late,
but finally here.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me about the 1.3 Update</strong></p>

<p>The main change in this release is the most requested feature from the
discussion boards: it is now possible to rewatch old online games and to
always see the last turn of an online game.</p>

<p>If an online game finishes while you are not actively playing, then it
will still be in your list of online games when you next start Concealed
Intent. If selected it will display the end screen with the game’s
outcome. If you want to see the last turn just click the “Replay Last”
button and it will be displayed. On the second time you start Concealed
Intent after the game has finished it will be moved to the Old Games
list - but you can still rewatch the whole game, read on!</p>

<p>At the end of an online game there is now a “Rewatch” button. Click this
and the entire game will be loaded and you can watch it from the start
either continuously (with the “Play All” button on the turn control part
of the GUI) or turn-by-turn (“Play Turn” button”).</p>

<p>It is also possible to rewatch any of your online games that have
finished in the last 90 days. Just go to the Old Games screen (available
via the Online screen) and click the “Rewatch” link next to the game you
wish to rewatch.</p>

<p>I had hoped to add rewatch to campaign and skirmish scenarios as well,
but that caused problems. 90% would play just fine, but some would badly
break due to the scripting system used to play out the turns. Fixing it
for all scenarios would require rewriting the scripting system and that
would take too long - so sadly you can only rewatch online games (which
do not have any complex scripting in them).</p>

<p>There are a few other minor changes and bugfixes - the details are
below.</p>

<p><strong>What is next for Concealed Intent?</strong></p>

<p>If there is a bad bug I will work to fix it. I can’t imagine not doing
that. Otherwise there are no plans to add more features.</p>

        <p><p>I have stated on a few occasions that I hoped to have a 1.3 Update
complete and released by the end of this year. My apologies, I will fail
to reach that goal. The plan is still to create another content update,
and it will still be called version 1.3, but it will not be complete by
the end of this year. I now hope to have it finished and ready by March 2018. 
However, that depends on whether the situation preventing me
finishing this year continues. The main issue is my “day job” for a
London startup, which has also become a “most evenings and some weekends
too” job. This job is taking so much of my time, there is almost none
for the prolonged periods of game coding that is how I best produce. I
believe it is likely that the effort the startup job requires will begin
to drop to more manageable levels in the new year (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>Again, my apologies. I have not forgotten Concealed Intent - it is just
that the 1.3 Update will be delayed a little.</p>

        <p><p>Delays, delays, delays. It has been three months since my last posting,
and five months since I did any work on Concealed Intent (with the 1.2
release). Since then I have moved continent and started a very busy day
job at a London startup.</p>

<p>I have also previously said there will be a 1.3 release by the end of
the year. Given current events, how is that going? It is still possible,
but only if I start work soon. This weekend I downloaded the most recent
version of Unity3D. Hopefully by now they have fixed most of the bugs.
If I can start finding time to make some progress over the next couple
of weekends then a 1.3 release by December is achievable.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/374150/discussions/">Steam
Forums</a> about what
the next version should contain. It seems the most regular players want
the ability to replay entire games after they are complete. So that will
be the main focus of the update. I will publish a list of goals for the
update once work has started and I have an idea of how much can be done.
If there is something you particularly want, speak now, because 1.3 will
probably be the last notable update for the game.</p>

<p>Sales of Concealed Intent have continued at a steady, but slow, pace
since the last financial posting. Below is the update sales vs costs
graph. There is a nice little bump every time a Steam Sale comes around,
but in-between only a handful of copies are sold. I have covered my
costs now, but nowhere close to being able to live on the profits and
develop a second game full-time (at least while living in London). Thus
the time consuming day job.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/cpd_revenue_2017.png" title="Concealed Intent - revenue vs costs" width="600" alt="Concealed Intent - revenue vs costs" /></p>

<p>Finally, for those with long memories, it was promised that Concealed
Intent would not bundled until at least the 3rd August 2017 (a full year
after release). Well that date has passed and the game has not yet been
bundled. I have not been contacted by bundlers since that date, but also
I’m not keen to bundle anyway. Looking at expected bundle sales, it
would not make much difference to the graph above. Also now I have a
job, I do not need the small amount of money bundling would bring. So,
while I am not renewing the non-bundling pledge (because if Humble
Bundle come knocking, I’m answering!), it is also probably unlikely that
Concealed Intent will be bundled in the near future.</p>

        <p><p>TLDR; moved country and got a day job, so gamedev work will slow; but
still aiming for a small Concealed Intent 1.3 update before end of the
year.</p>

<p>It has been a while since my last update on the happenings and plans for
Concealed Intent and Jarrah Technology - time to rectify that.</p>

<p>As some of you may be aware, just this week I moved from Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia to London, UK for my partner’s work (as was the original move
to Malaysia). I am writing this while looking out on a surprisingly
pleasant English summer day. Preparing for the move has meant I have not
managed any significant time for gamedev work on Concealed Intent or my
next game over the last couple of months.</p>

<p>Now I’m set up in London, it’s time for gamedev, right? Unfortunately
not. London is an extremely expensive city, and indie gamedev will not
pay the bills, so I will need a day job. In fact I already have one (not
in games) and start tomorrow. This means my available time for my own
projects will greatly diminish. However, I do not intend to completely
stop, instead dropping down to probably just a few hours per week on
average.</p>

<p>I am now a hobbyist gamedev rather than a professional indie gamedev.</p>

<p>The plan is still to release a 1.3 update to Concealed Intent by the end
of the year. The aim is to have this include about 2 weeks of
development work (plus testing). Only now that work will be spread out
over several months rather than in a single block. This means that there
probably will not be time to work on another game until at least next
year. The first task on the 1.3 list is to update the game to the latest
Unity 5 release to help ensure future compatibility and performance.
Then work will focus on the items left out of the 1.2 release - mainly
small UX improvements. After that I’ll reassess the time available and
the scope of previously suggested “nice to have” features to see what
can be realistically achieved.</p>

<p>My next update will give more information on the Concealed Intent 1.3
plan and features.</p>

        <p><p>The Concealed Intent 1.2 release is out now! You may remember I said it
would be out before the end of March. My apologies for being a week
late, but on the bright side I now know a great deal about password
hashing and HTTPS.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tell me about the 1.2 Update</em></strong></p>

<p>Among the bug fixes and minor improvements there are a few niceties
added. Truly randomly generated skirmish maps (the 3 ‘?’ options when
configuring a skirmish). The Skirmish configuration page will now
remember the last settings and return to it on restart or just after a
scenario. Also, there are two new types of drone: the Stealth Drone, an
underpowered laser drone with some countermeasures; and the Detonation
Drone, a heavy drone mounting an improved multi-pulse laser that
unfortunately has a 95% chance of exploding when fired. Have fun!</p>

<p>The biggest change is a new version of the game without Steam’s DRM.
This will go up on other online stores like Humble and Itch.io. However,
that does not seem fair to Steam purchasers. Thus if you send me a
message from your Steam account (so I can confirm you have a copy of the
game in your Steam account) I will send you a link to a a non-DRM
version download. Personally, I would not recommend this, the Steam DRM
version is the best version as it handles online logins, challenges and
turn notifications automatically for the player, but if you have a
philosophical problem with DRM (then why are you using Steam?) there is
the non-DRM version available.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is next?</em></strong></p>

<p>As always any bug fixes will take priority over other tasks. Assuming I
am not busy fixing issues, I will be completing all the tasks required
to move to a country/continent in May (which have been delayed a week
while finishing this update). Afterwards there will hopefully be time
for some work on my next game.</p>

<p>So, the plan is I will get back to the Concealed Intent towards the end
of this year with work on a 1.3 update. That will start with the items
left out of this 1.2 release due to running out of time. Then back to
working down the list of suggestions (I read them all). As I get closer
to starting, there will be a post here with more details.</p>
