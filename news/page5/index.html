        <p><p>September is over and the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/374150/announcements/detail/582476975922474209">scheduled month of dev work for Concealed
Intent 1.1
complete</a>.
The amount achieved was about as much as expected, although not as much
as hoped. Since the last update Steam turn notifications are working,
but it was a little harder than anticipated. Then came a new skirmish
objective (Gather) and a bunch of bug fixes (mainly for Linux).
Unfortunately that means there was not time for extra work on campaign
missions or online. Still, the update is a large body of work and I’m
glad to get it done, the game will be better for it. Now I just need to
test it extensively before release! The plan is to give myself a
fortnight of testing, so look for the update in mid-October (barring
major issues).</p>

<p>Looking at my Concealed Intent todo list I am amazed by how short it is - the shortest it has been since starting! It contains probably about a
fortnight of online server improvements (not visible to players) and
another fortnight of campaign/skirmish/cosmetic improvements. There are
also a half-dozen “nice-to-haves”. Given this list, I am inclined to do
a month’s work for a 1.2 update. However, it will not be until next year - hopefully earlier rather than later. After Concealed Intent 1.1 is
released I will start work on a much smaller space-themed game codenamed
“Blockade Runner” (because I haven’t thought of anything better yet).</p>

<p>Here are the final notes on the original (and intentionally overly
ambitious) update plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements - the main things here are an automated
build system and better feedback management. Both are complete.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements - most of these were done as part
of 1.0.1. A few more have been done - most notably an onscreen shielding
effect and a plan breakdown on the player focus buttons.</li>
  <li>Linux support - There is now a Linux build for internal testing, so
far it has performed just like the PC/Mac version.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes - many bugfixes completed and the issue list is empty
again.</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications - Working, but needs more testing.</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions - a little balance work has been
done, but there are no new campaign missions.</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns - done, the new Gather objective has the player rushing</li>
  <li>Online improvements - nothing significant for players done here.</li>
</ul>

  <br/>
        <p><p>It has been a little while since my last update, so I thought I should
let people know what is happening with Concealed Intent. Previously I
wrote about creating some prototypes and having time off. Both those
achievements have been unlocked! If you would like to see my thoughts on
prototypes, <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">look here</a>. After that I
said there would be a month’s work on a 1.1 release, trying to get as
far down this list as possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements to the client and server code</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements, as suggested through player
feedback</li>
  <li>Linux support</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns</li>
  <li>Online improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>Work began on this list at the start of September. Thus I will stop
developing and start testing at the end of this month. Assuming no big
issues are found, I’m still on track for an October release.</p>

<p>So how am I progressing with the list? Firstly, there were a couple of
things not considered. On the positive side, there was a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/374150/announcements/detail/595985181035046794">1.0.1
release</a>
that contained many of the <em>Cosmetic and control improvements</em>, so much
of that task was done before I began. On the downside, my hard drive
crashed the day I planned to start work, costing me a couple of days
productivity (keep your backups up to date!). Also, I forgot to add
bugfixes into that todo list. Thanks to more testing and the good work
of a couple of players (obliviondoll and FridayBiology were particularly
helpful) a few extra bugs were discovered and have (or will be) fixed as
a priority.</p>

<p>So how is that list actually looking as of today?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements - the main things here are an automated
build system and better feedback management. Both are complete, and
while players will notice little difference, both should save me loads
of time to work on other tasks. There are lots of other backend tasks
that need to be done, but I will probably leave them until later.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements - most of these were done as part
of 1.0.1. A few more have been done (most notably an onscreen shielding
effect). There is one item outstanding, but I haven’t scoped it yet -
I’ll try to work out if it is possible in the coming week.</li>
  <li>Linux support - There is now a Linux build for internal testing, so
far it has performed just like the PC/Mac version with the exception of
a few cosmetic issues. This task is looking good. Strangely, my Linux
version has issues with anti-aliasing which has meant the height-markers
for all versions have needed to change.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes - there are now four minor bugs outstanding I’ll be starting
work on over the next week. A few other minor bug fixes will be in the
next release, plus a major online game fix that has already been
released. Please let me know if you see anything “weird” or “wrong”.</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications - Just started work on this and the
documentation is making a great deal more sense than the last time I
looked. Confident I can get it done.</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions - a little balance work has been
done (coolers will be nerfed in 1.1) and I have ideas for more things
here, but am currently uncertain if I should do an extra couple of
missions or a new skirmish type first - I might only have time for one
(but will of course try for both).</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns - see above, if you have any ideas let me know.</li>
  <li>Online improvements - probably will not make it far enough to do
anything here, but if I do it will be something small</li>
</ul>

<p>There it is. I would say progress so far is better than expected
(especially considering the hard drive crash), but who knows how things
will go for the remainder of the month. In any case, be assured I am
working hard trying to improve the game!</p>

        <p><p>It takes more than one game to become a successful game studio. A
portfolio of games is required to spread risk. This is even more the
case for Jarrah Technology, as on current trends Concealed Intent will
not be a financial success. I am committed to a 1.1 update and have
started work towards that goal. However, realistically any time spent
will not reap a corresponding financial reward. Thus with the little
time remaining to me for working on games full-time, I need to come up
with new games quickly. Luckily, ideas are not the problem. There are
exceptionally few “ideas people” in games, because everyone has tons of
ideas. Choosing which potential games deserve the risk of developing
with limited resources is the real skill.</p>

<p>Over the last four years I’ve compiled a list of three dozen “maybe
later” game ideas. They are of variable quality, but there is no
standout, clearly a winner, concept. So how to choose? After Concealed
Intent I have a few requirements for my next game. First, it must be
simple. Simple to develop and simple to play. With only a few months
left available for unrestricted development, any game I start must be
finished within 9 months or risk never being finished. Realistically,
with Concealed Intent work and other distractions, 6 months is the
maximum time. Thus since I also repeatedly underestimate effort
significantly, I want games that I think I can create in about 3 months.
So an order of magnitude smaller than Concealed Intent. This has many
implications. For a start, no story, that takes too long (or at least,
it takes me too long). Also, my next game will be 2D or 3D with a fixed
camera. Having a fully mobile camera in a 3D world adds a host of UI and
control problems. The next game needs to be relatively cheap to make
(not including my time). Being able to reuse existing assets is best,
otherwise I need to be aware of how much extra cost is required and
factor that into to likely earnings. It is a fuzzy line.</p>

<p>The game should be simple to play. Definitely no complex internal
simulation models. It should be clear what is happening on the screen
and quick to learn. This is for two reasons: it is easier to develop;
and, it widens the market of the game. Concealed Intent is complex to
play, and difficult to learn. There is a lot of maths happening “under
the hood”. This greatly decreases the number of people willing to play.
The vast majority of potential players (and press) will only play the
game for a few minutes. If after that time they are still going through
a tutorial explaining mathematical game concepts, most will stop and
never start again. Thus, my next game will just have a couple of simple
game mechanics.</p>

<p>So those are the criteria for evaluating ideas: quick, simple, cheap
(and fun!). With that in mind my long list became a short list of 4. So
I decided to prototype them. Two on paper as the technical complexity is
low, so the gameplay elements are most important. Two in code as the
most challenging part would be the programming. At this stage I don’t
want to talk too much about what each idea actually involves - it is too
soon. Instead, here are photos of each game in progress.</p>

        <p><p>Done. Concealed Intent is now fully released. No longer is it marked
with the stigma of Early Access.</p>

<p>For the next week there is a 34% launch discount on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Steam</a>, and now for the
first time it is also available on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/concealed-intent">Humble
Store</a> too (same
discount).</p>

<p>The success of a modern games tends to be determined in their first
month of release. Visibility, reviews and sales now will result in more
visibility, reviews and sales later. So I’m not too proud to beg… If you
enjoy the game please consider telling people about it and/or writing a
review on Steam. It will all help. Also, if you do see something wrong
in the game, please let me know, the quicker I can find and fix any
issues the better.</p>

<p>Right now I’m also incredibly busy trying to get the word out and
responding to people’s messages. I am way behind. One of the more
interesting things I’m doing is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/4vvrpa/my_game_was_released_today_on_steam_after_years/">Reddit
AMA</a>.
Come along and ask me anything? Everyone who comments (with a question
or otherwise) by Friday 5th August 10:00am GMT will go into the running
to win one of 10 copies of Concealed Intent.</p>

<p>Development work is not over, there will still at least be a version 1.1
update at some point. However, I think the largest part of game is now
complete. Reaching a standard I felt happy about and then saying that
people can pay for it without that Early Access caveat is a huge step.</p>

<p>Having said all that, I would also like to give a huge thank you to
everyone who played Concealed Intent, purchased it, wishlisted/followed
it, or even just checked it out. This game could not have been finished
to this level (or even at all) without your support and feedback. Thank
you!</p>

<p>Paraphrasing Shakleton’s recruiting notice for Antarctic exploration
works surprisingly well for indiedevs too.</p>

<p>Today is the culmination (but not termination) of nearly four years of
effort. My game, Concealed Intent, is now out of Early Access and fully
released on Steam. It has easily been the largest project I have ever
undertaken and required intense effort to reach this point. Working
largely alone in a foreign country I often found myself questioning what
I was doing. However, in retrospect, I would still do it over again -
but with a few changes (see the “What went not so well” list below).</p>

<p>After a brief (and shameless) video interlude for Concealed Intent
itself, I will detail the things I think went right and not so well
during the development process. I have tried to think back to my state
of mind four years ago, just before starting and offer advice to that
naive and optimistic person. A later post, some time after the release,
will look at the business and financial side of the game - was it
profitable: stay tuned to find out!</p>

        <p><p>One of the game development tasks I have found particular difficult is
writing a good tutorial. Of course, best would be no tutorial at all.
Unfortunately, Concealed Intent is much too complex to be playable with
the player doing a little learning first - and that complexity is part
of the game’s design. Numerous hours have been spent tuning the
tutorial, but it is still a little clunky - probably the result of my
inexperience and the nature of the game. To help overcome this and the
common subtle misunderstandings, I have created a couple of videos to
help newbies. They will be added to the game page, the press kit and
maybe even as a link in the game itself.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/czbgsBdT-Bg">20 minute tutorial on how to
play:</a></p>

Sky is released that day. It seemed best to go a week early. I’ll need
to get going on marketing quickly.</p>

<p>Also, if you enjoy the game, writing a positive Steam review is hugely
useful. I would be greatly appreciative, please consider it.</p>

blog</a></em></p>

<p>I have set up a new website: <a href="http://www.agamedevplays.com/">A Gamedev
Plays…</a> will be dedicated to
discussion and reviews of all sorts of games (but mostly games that I
want to play). There is already an associated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a> and
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/agamedevplays">Steam group</a>. I will be
using the Jarrah Technology
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/JarrahTech">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook</a> pages for
promotional purposes at the moment.</p>

<p>The plan for the new site is to play more games and write about them,
both as a game design learning exercise and as motivation to create more
myself. As a secondary goal, I also hope to create a small community
around my games writing.</p>

<p>There is an explosion of game making at the moment. More and more games,
many with innovative ideas are being released. I need to be aware of
what is happening in game design. Since starting work on my own games I
can’t help but try to analyse what makes a game work (or not!) when I
play it. Being able to organise these thoughts into a coherent argument
in a presentable form can only help me improve my future games.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>As my indie game nears a full release, my interest in indie marketing
increases. Recently I was on the <a href="https://www.spacegamejunkie.com/">Space Game
Junkie</a> podcast, and one of the hosts
mentioned that the <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com">Steamgifts</a> website had
not worked well for their sales effort. At that point I was planning on
including the site for marketing Concealed Intent’s full release. There
are a number of game giveaways on Steamgifts with messages stating they
are for marketing purposes, and a few people have contacted me asking
for keys to giveaway on the website (all refused, I can do it myself).
So I wondered, how useful is Steamgifts as a marketing channel? Not
finding any information online, I decided to try a few amateur
experiments just to see how it worked.</p>

<p>For those that don’t know, Steamgifts is a website where members can
give away copies of Steam (and only Steam) games. There are hundreds of
games given away each day. It is not designed as a site for game
marketing, but giveaway creators can include a short message, and these
are often explicitly advertising related (for a game, or group, or
YouTube channel, etc). The winner is chosen at random among those
members of the site who have chosen to enter. Members are restricted in
the number of giveaways they can enter, and must have at least $100
worth of games on their Steam account (so it is hard to enter a giveaway
multiple times). There are currently a <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/XaCbA/list-of-all-cv-levels-and-their-corresponding-real-cv">little over 900,000
members</a>,
of which around 135,000 have given away at least one game, and some many
more. If a giveaways is open to everyone for over a day it will usually
have 1000-2000 entries, depending on the game. Some very large giveaways
(50+ copies) or desirable games gather 10,000+ entries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/giveaway/LttHx/concealed-intent">Here is an example of a
giveaway</a>
created for this experiment. The marketing text in the message is the
standard copy for my Steam Early Access game, Concealed Intent. A brief
description of the game, followed by a link and call-to-action, “please
wishlist the game” (I thought a “please buy” CTA might be overly
ambitious), then some social media links. The only way to enter the
competition is through this webpage. So theoretically everyone who
enters the giveaway should be exposed to the message.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/steamgifts/steamgifts_impressions.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do very little marketing for the game at the moment, because as a sole
developer I chose to spend most of my time on development tasks. This
will shift in the next few weeks as full release nears and I go nearly
full-time on marketing. However, during the experiment, I did no other
marketing so views on the Steam store page are at a low and baseline
level. Above is a graph of the store page impressions according to
Steam, the grey line is total visits. Can you see the giveaways’ effect?
There are 8 giveaways through this period, each separated by at least a
day. The two most successful giveaways ended on the 11th May &amp; 17th May.
On those days there is a noticeable jump in direct visits to the store
page (the light blue line).</p>

<p>Let’s see the raw numbers for Concealed Intent giveaways. I made two
giveaways, each for a few days, a week apart. Both giveaways spanned the
same days of the week. The number of visitors from Steamgifts to the
Steam store page is measured through Google Analytics (which I suspect
under counts visits slightly), and the number of extra wishlist entries
is taken from Steam after subtracting the baseline growth in the week
before I started the giveaways (1.5 per day).</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Entries</th>

      <td style="text-align: center">11</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>7.9%</strong></td>

      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>4.6%</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>0.8%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I believe this CTR compares very favourably with other advertising.
However, it must be considered that the cost of each giveaway is a copy
of Concealed Intent, with a retail price of US$15, making those clicks
extremely expensive by traditional measures. Although, that is only the
case if the winner was going to buy the game at full price (or at all),
probably unlikely given current indie game sales. Both winners did
immediately redeem the game and play, which makes me happy. There were
no extra sales in during the giveaway period, but I did gain a couple of
Twitter followers (of course I can’t be sure they came from Steamgifts).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that rise in the number of entries for the
second giveaway corresponds with a drop in CTR. Perhaps the second
giveaway included many people already aware of the game from the first
giveaway. In any case, there may be diminishing returns on repeated
giveaways. Thus they didn’t need to pay much attention to the text or
visit the store a second time. I suspect a third giveaway would be even
lower.</p>

<p>Prior to giving away my own game, I also tried giving different games
for which I had keys leftover from bundle purchases, all with the same
Concealed Intent marketing message attached. The *’ed rows indicate
multiple overlapping giveaways with aggregated statistics.</p>

<p>Here the CTR is much lower. So low in fact I think that errors in
counting visits or random changes in non-Steamgifts wishlisting will
greatly skew the figures. Basically, giving away other people’s bundled
game does not have much effect (although of course using bundled games
means there is not much expense either). I would suggest relatively few
people read the message, and most of the clicks are from checking out
the game actually being given away before entering (rather than for the
game in the marketing copy - makes sense to me).</p>

<p>So giving away my game on Steamgifts netted me at least 117 views of my
Steam Store page and onto 19 extra wishlists for a cost between 0 -
US$30. Other marketing opportunities available to indiedevs are:
self-promotion on social media; asking web magazines and YouTubers for
coverage; or paying hard cash for advertising. Given this, I would
consider using Steamgifts giveaways again - just to increase awareness
of the game. Although in small numbers (1 at a time), spaced with larger
time gaps between them (at least a week), and only until awareness of
the game reaches some as yet undefined level.</p>

<p>It is left as an exercise for a reader to measure the marketing
effectiveness of giving away 50+ copies at once. I am not brave enough
to try it with my game (at least not yet).</p>

<p>I am very interested to hear other people’s experiences or comments.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I linked this post in the Steamgifts forum and an
interesting discussion ensued over the value of 50+ giveaways or
restricting entry to more engaged members. <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/oC2fe/steamgifts-for-marketing">Here it
is</a>,
worth a read if you found this interesting.</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-07-09</em> - Hi Anton, I agree that using the full retail value of the game is not completely valid, although I disagree there is no cost at all. There is an opportunity cost, but it will be much smaller than the retail, as it would only be the case if the person winning the game would buy the game anyway. So the cost per giveaway will be somewhere between 0 &amp; US$15. I just don’t know where. the full retail is a handy maximum. Other numbers would be US$11.04 (the average amount paid including discounts and foreign currencies), US$10 (the last sale price), about US$6 (what I get per average copy after Steam &amp; tax). The likelihood (so far) of someone buying after going to the game’s store page is around 1 in 10000 (and about 1 in 1000 for wishlisting, so hopefully the sales will improve after full release). On that basis the value per view is less than a cent! Now I’ve worked that all out, it is a bit depressing. I just had another check of the Steam backend and I can’t find the number of follows the game has. Sales, wishlists and views are all very clear, but I can’t see follows. Doesn’t mean they are not there somewhere, I’ll keep looking. Sounds like you have some nice friends :)</p>

<p><em>unknown @ 2016-07-09</em> - comment deleted</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-07-11</em> - It is a grey area :) Steam rules say I can’t give out the financials. I think I’m probably safe given that. To work out Steam’s cut from the above you would need to know my tax rate, refund rate and chargeback rate, plus the exact amount. So it is not obvious. Then again details of Steam’s cut is not hard to find - Cliffski (much bigger dev than me) put it on his blog just this weekend (<a href="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/07/09/why-valve-should-give-jobs-to-journalists/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2016/07/09/why-valve-should-give-jobs-to-journalists/">http://positech.co.uk/cliff…</a> ) and Garry Newman put up his sales &amp; refund rates (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276450/Rust_Garrys_Mod_dev_shares_data_on_refund_rates.php" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/276450/Rust_Garrys_Mod_dev_shares_data_on_refund_rates.php">http://www.gamasutra.com/vi…</a> ). So if that is ok, I think my vague numbers are ok :)</p>
