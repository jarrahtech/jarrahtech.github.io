  <br/>
        <p><p>TLDR; moved country and got a day job, so gamedev work will slow; but
still aiming for a small Concealed Intent 1.3 update before end of the
year.</p>

<p>It has been a while since my last update on the happenings and plans for
Concealed Intent and Jarrah Technology - time to rectify that.</p>

<p>As some of you may be aware, just this week I moved from Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia to London, UK for my partner’s work (as was the original move
to Malaysia). I am writing this while looking out on a surprisingly
pleasant English summer day. Preparing for the move has meant I have not
managed any significant time for gamedev work on Concealed Intent or my
next game over the last couple of months.</p>

<p>Now I’m set up in London, it’s time for gamedev, right? Unfortunately
not. London is an extremely expensive city, and indie gamedev will not
pay the bills, so I will need a day job. In fact I already have one (not
in games) and start tomorrow. This means my available time for my own
projects will greatly diminish. However, I do not intend to completely
stop, instead dropping down to probably just a few hours per week on
average.</p>

<p>I am now a hobbyist gamedev rather than a professional indie gamedev.</p>

<p>The plan is still to release a 1.3 update to Concealed Intent by the end
of the year. The aim is to have this include about 2 weeks of
development work (plus testing). Only now that work will be spread out
over several months rather than in a single block. This means that there
probably will not be time to work on another game until at least next
year. The first task on the 1.3 list is to update the game to the latest
Unity 5 release to help ensure future compatibility and performance.
Then work will focus on the items left out of the 1.2 release - mainly
small UX improvements. After that I’ll reassess the time available and
the scope of previously suggested “nice to have” features to see what
can be realistically achieved.</p>

<p>My next update will give more information on the Concealed Intent 1.3
plan and features.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>The Concealed Intent 1.2 release is out now! You may remember I said it
would be out before the end of March. My apologies for being a week
late, but on the bright side I now know a great deal about password
hashing and HTTPS.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tell me about the 1.2 Update</em></strong></p>

<p>Among the bug fixes and minor improvements there are a few niceties
added. Truly randomly generated skirmish maps (the 3 ‘?’ options when
configuring a skirmish). The Skirmish configuration page will now
remember the last settings and return to it on restart or just after a
scenario. Also, there are two new types of drone: the Stealth Drone, an
underpowered laser drone with some countermeasures; and the Detonation
Drone, a heavy drone mounting an improved multi-pulse laser that
unfortunately has a 95% chance of exploding when fired. Have fun!</p>

<p>The biggest change is a new version of the game without Steam’s DRM.
This will go up on other online stores like Humble and Itch.io. However,
that does not seem fair to Steam purchasers. Thus if you send me a
message from your Steam account (so I can confirm you have a copy of the
game in your Steam account) I will send you a link to a a non-DRM
version download. Personally, I would not recommend this, the Steam DRM
version is the best version as it handles online logins, challenges and
turn notifications automatically for the player, but if you have a
philosophical problem with DRM (then why are you using Steam?) there is
the non-DRM version available.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is next?</em></strong></p>

<p>As always any bug fixes will take priority over other tasks. Assuming I
am not busy fixing issues, I will be completing all the tasks required
to move to a country/continent in May (which have been delayed a week
while finishing this update). Afterwards there will hopefully be time
for some work on my next game.</p>

<p>So, the plan is I will get back to the Concealed Intent towards the end
of this year with work on a 1.3 update. That will start with the items
left out of this 1.2 release due to running out of time. Then back to
working down the list of suggestions (I read them all). As I get closer
to starting, there will be a post here with more details.</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>A few events have recently occurred, with a few more on the horizon.
Thus it is time to replan work for the next couple months. First the
important stuff - what I’ll be doing. Then I’ll explain why.</p>

<p><strong>Concealed Intent 1.2 Update</strong></p>

<p>It has been too long since touching the Concealed Intent codebase. I’m
getting withdrawal symptoms. Over the next month or so I will start work
on an update to Concealed Intent. Aiming for around 3 weeks worth of
work, plus testing. Assuming I haven’t forgotten too much, it should be
out by the end of March.</p>

<p>The first and main task of this update will be producing a version of
the game without Steam DRM. Then a couple of new gameplay features will
be added (a truly random map option in skirmishes, new drones). I have
collected a few good suggestions to improve the UI, and I hope to get
them done too. If there is still time after that I’ll just keep going
through my list.</p>

<p><strong>What is Steam DRM doing in Concealed Intent?</strong></p>

<p>Concealed Intent uses Steam DRM to identify and authenticate players.
This information allows the game to automatically login players into the
online system without the need for a username or password. This is why
you can start Concealed Intent and immediately play online. The problem
with Steam DRM is that it locks the game to the Steam platform, which is
not a bad thing for people playing the game on Steam, but means I can’t
sell the game on other platforms.</p>

<p>Considering the potential impact of Steam Direct (see below), I think it
is important to loosen this restriction on myself. Players on Steam will
not notice any difference, but it will mean I can sell non-Steam
versions of the game. These non-Steam versions will have online
registration, logon and password recovery screens (and players will need
to login before playing online), but will otherwise be the same.</p>

<p><strong>Steam Direct?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/558846854614253751">Steam
Direct</a>
will be Valve’s replacement for Steam Greenlight as the method to get a
game onto Steam. Coming in a few months, it will require a flat fee be
paid to Valve in return for each game added to the Steam platform.
Estimates of this fee range from US$100 to US$5000. At the bottom of
this range I fail to see how the fee will have desired effect
(preventing exploitative games). At the high end of the range some small
devs, like me, will struggle.</p>

<p>I should point out that I know Valve has every right to organise their
platform how they want, and their stated goal is laudable. However, as a
small indie dev it would be very easy to be crushed by any changes as an
unfortunate, unintended and unnoticed side effect. Although I think it
likely that the fee will fall towards the low end of Valve’s range and I
will probably be ok, it is still a wake up call. At the moment I am
completely dependent on the Steam ecosystem and Valve’s benevolence. To
protect myself, I am going to start looking towards other platforms.
Thus the non-Steam DRM version of Concealed Intent as an initial
learning exercise and start upon this path.</p>

<p><strong>So what have you been doing the last couple of months?</strong></p>

<p>After taking a break over the holiday season, I have started work on a
new game. I don’t have a name yet and it is still all developer artwork
(amazingly ugly!). So I am not ready to show people or talk much about
it yet, although I am happy with the way it is progressing. Right now it
has reached a natural pause point. After finishing the CI update I will
get back to it with some refactoring, prettifying and expanding out of
the already completed vertical slice of gameplay. Oh, and decide upon a
name. Then it was supposed to be time for Greenlight… not sure what will
happen now.</p>

<p>I have also been playing games again! While developing CI, there was
little time to play games, but now I set aside a couple of hours per
week to play games of interest or just from my backlog. To help keep
this up I record my sessions and put them up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">A Gamedev Plays… on
YouTube</a></p>

<p><strong>What happens after Concealed Intent 1.2?</strong></p>

<p>First, I will fix any bugs that appear. Otherwise I will get back to
work on my next game and look to start promoting it. However, this will
be affected by the fact I will be moving country around May. This is
likely to also require me to find a new job as developing games will not
pay the bills in the vastly more expensive country I will soon reside. I
cannot make any guarantees as to what I can achieve in the the second
half of the year. However, I hope to finish my second game and release
another small Concealed Intent update.</p>

        <p><p>With a new year, it is time to evaluate how Jarrah Technology is
progressing and determine a plan for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Concealed Intent</strong></p>

<p>My first game, Concealed Intent, was fully released on Steam at the
beginning of August. Since then there have been a few minor bugfix
releases and one major (1.1) update which included Linux support.
Reviews are generally positive, players on the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/374150/discussions/">forums</a> are great,
although sales have been slow. Below is an updated graph of revenue vs
costs from my <a href="/2016/10/17/Release-Postmortem/">postmortem</a>. Revenue
will probably stagnate over the next few months as the effect of
numerous platform sales subside. Valuing my time at zero (never a good
idea), the game should be profitable before mid-year. Not awful, but not
a great result.</p>

        <p><p>It has been a while, so perhaps time for an update on what is happening
and what is planned for the near future.</p>

<p>Right now I am working through ideas and mechanics for Project Blockade
Runner. That is not its real name, but I haven’t thought of anything
better yet. It is still at a very early stage, and the basic concept is
still mutating (the blockade part is decreasing in prominence), so I
don’t want to share screenshots yet. Although for people who regularly
read this blog, it was one of the paper prototypes from <a href="/2016/08/30/Prototyping">this
post</a>, shown again below. This one seemed the
most interesting to me. Also, I think the basic game mechanic can be
reused as an engine in a couple of different games. So this one scored
best on interest, ease and business. You can be confident there will be
more info about this game in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/prototypes/blockade_full.png"><img src="/assets/posts/prototypes/blockade.png" alt="Blockade Runner prototype" title="Blockade Runner prototype" /></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the game seems to be more Blocked Runner at the moment.
My personal log says I have managed just 17 hours work on the project so
far - and it shows. What has been happening instead over the last five
weeks since the Concealed Intent 1.1 update? Well, I went away for a
week to recharge. Very nice break it was too. Many admin tasks that were
“left for later” as Concealed Intent headed towards release back in
August are now completed. According to my log that has taken 42 hours of
effort in recent weeks. There was quite a backlog, but they are all done
now. I have also been playing games. Of course this is work, really it
is! I have put some videos up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">my personal YouTube
channel</a> and
associated <a href="www.agamedevplays.com">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Also there has been a dribble of work on Concealed Intent. Two small bug
fix updates have been released. If there are more bugs discovered I will
fix them ASAP. Otherwise, I will be taking a break from the game until
the new year. At this stage I’m fairly determined to make at least a 1.2
release before the middle of 2017. After that it will depend on sales
and time. I have started compiling a list of “must-have” items for a 1.2
version. Currently there are 8 items on it comprising about a week’s
work. That means there is another fortnight or “nice-to-have” items that
I could do, plus maybe another week of experimental/exploratory items.
That would make for a decent solid release. I have a good list of
possibles improvements. Anyone who contacts me with a suggestion also
gets it added to the list for consideration.</p>

<p>I had better get back to work!</p>

  <br/>
        <p><p>After way too long in development <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed
Intent</a> was fully released on
the 2nd August following 9 months in Steam’s Early Access program. This
post details some useful stats I collected between starting EA, through
to the end of September. The kind of information I would have found
interesting, at least for comparison purposes. Hope someone else finds
it useful.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent is a simultaneous turn-based game of 3D tactical space
combat. It is probably a niche game (turn-based tactics), with a crowded
theme (space games seem very common right now). It was created by a solo
dev (with some outsourced 2D art), and thus it was hard to manage both
development and marketing. Mainly the marketing suffered, especially
considering my inexperience. Raising awareness of Concealed Intent and
the release campaign could have been managed much better - I will know
for next time! For my lessons learnt see <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/CharlesCordingley/20160802/278357/Concealed_Intent_Development_Postmortem.php">this Gamasutra

        <p><p>September is over and the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/374150/announcements/detail/582476975922474209">scheduled month of dev work for Concealed
Intent 1.1
complete</a>.
The amount achieved was about as much as expected, although not as much
as hoped. Since the last update Steam turn notifications are working,
but it was a little harder than anticipated. Then came a new skirmish
objective (Gather) and a bunch of bug fixes (mainly for Linux).
Unfortunately that means there was not time for extra work on campaign
missions or online. Still, the update is a large body of work and I’m
glad to get it done, the game will be better for it. Now I just need to
test it extensively before release! The plan is to give myself a
fortnight of testing, so look for the update in mid-October (barring
major issues).</p>

<p>Looking at my Concealed Intent todo list I am amazed by how short it is - the shortest it has been since starting! It contains probably about a
fortnight of online server improvements (not visible to players) and
another fortnight of campaign/skirmish/cosmetic improvements. There are
also a half-dozen “nice-to-haves”. Given this list, I am inclined to do
a month’s work for a 1.2 update. However, it will not be until next year - hopefully earlier rather than later. After Concealed Intent 1.1 is
released I will start work on a much smaller space-themed game codenamed
“Blockade Runner” (because I haven’t thought of anything better yet).</p>

<p>Here are the final notes on the original (and intentionally overly
ambitious) update plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements - the main things here are an automated
build system and better feedback management. Both are complete.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements - most of these were done as part
of 1.0.1. A few more have been done - most notably an onscreen shielding
effect and a plan breakdown on the player focus buttons.</li>
  <li>Linux support - There is now a Linux build for internal testing, so
far it has performed just like the PC/Mac version.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes - many bugfixes completed and the issue list is empty
again.</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications - Working, but needs more testing.</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions - a little balance work has been
done, but there are no new campaign missions.</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and

        <p><p>It has been a little while since my last update, so I thought I should
let people know what is happening with Concealed Intent. Previously I
wrote about creating some prototypes and having time off. Both those
achievements have been unlocked! If you would like to see my thoughts on
prototypes, <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">look here</a>. After that I
said there would be a month’s work on a 1.1 release, trying to get as
far down this list as possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements to the client and server code</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements, as suggested through player
feedback</li>
  <li>Linux support</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns</li>
  <li>Online improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>Work began on this list at the start of September. Thus I will stop
developing and start testing at the end of this month. Assuming no big
issues are found, I’m still on track for an October release.</p>

<p>So how am I progressing with the list? Firstly, there were a couple of
things not considered. On the positive side, there was a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/374150/announcements/detail/595985181035046794">1.0.1
release</a>
that contained many of the <em>Cosmetic and control improvements</em>, so much
of that task was done before I began. On the downside, my hard drive
crashed the day I planned to start work, costing me a couple of days
productivity (keep your backups up to date!). Also, I forgot to add
bugfixes into that todo list. Thanks to more testing and the good work
of a couple of players (obliviondoll and FridayBiology were particularly
helpful) a few extra bugs were discovered and have (or will be) fixed as
a priority.</p>

<p>So how is that list actually looking as of today?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Small backend improvements - the main things here are an automated
build system and better feedback management. Both are complete, and
while players will notice little difference, both should save me loads
of time to work on other tasks. There are lots of other backend tasks
that need to be done, but I will probably leave them until later.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic and control improvements - most of these were done as part
of 1.0.1. A few more have been done (most notably an onscreen shielding
effect). There is one item outstanding, but I haven’t scoped it yet -
I’ll try to work out if it is possible in the coming week.</li>
  <li>Linux support - There is now a Linux build for internal testing, so
far it has performed just like the PC/Mac version with the exception of
a few cosmetic issues. This task is looking good. Strangely, my Linux
version has issues with anti-aliasing which has meant the height-markers
for all versions have needed to change.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes - there are now four minor bugs outstanding I’ll be starting
work on over the next week. A few other minor bug fixes will be in the
next release, plus a major online game fix that has already been
released. Please let me know if you see anything “weird” or “wrong”.</li>
  <li>Steam turn notifications - Just started work on this and the
documentation is making a great deal more sense than the last time I
looked. Confident I can get it done.</li>
  <li>Balance &amp; extra campaign missions - a little balance work has been
done (coolers will be nerfed in 1.1) and I have ideas for more things
here, but am currently uncertain if I should do an extra couple of
missions or a new skirmish type first - I might only have time for one
(but will of course try for both).</li>
  <li>Extra skirmish mode making better use of tentative contacts and
neutral unknowns - see above, if you have any ideas let me know.</li>
  <li>Online improvements - probably will not make it far enough to do
anything here, but if I do it will be something small</li>
</ul>

<p>There it is. I would say progress so far is better than expected
(especially considering the hard drive crash), but who knows how things
will go for the remainder of the month. In any case, be assured I am
working hard trying to improve the game!</p>

        <p><p>It takes more than one game to become a successful game studio. A
portfolio of games is required to spread risk. This is even more the
case for Jarrah Technology, as on current trends Concealed Intent will
not be a financial success. I am committed to a 1.1 update and have
started work towards that goal. However, realistically any time spent
will not reap a corresponding financial reward. Thus with the little
time remaining to me for working on games full-time, I need to come up
with new games quickly. Luckily, ideas are not the problem. There are
exceptionally few “ideas people” in games, because everyone has tons of
ideas. Choosing which potential games deserve the risk of developing
with limited resources is the real skill.</p>

<p>Over the last four years I’ve compiled a list of three dozen “maybe
later” game ideas. They are of variable quality, but there is no
standout, clearly a winner, concept. So how to choose? After Concealed
Intent I have a few requirements for my next game. First, it must be
simple. Simple to develop and simple to play. With only a few months
left available for unrestricted development, any game I start must be
finished within 9 months or risk never being finished. Realistically,
with Concealed Intent work and other distractions, 6 months is the
maximum time. Thus since I also repeatedly underestimate effort
significantly, I want games that I think I can create in about 3 months.
So an order of magnitude smaller than Concealed Intent. This has many
implications. For a start, no story, that takes too long (or at least,
it takes me too long). Also, my next game will be 2D or 3D with a fixed
camera. Having a fully mobile camera in a 3D world adds a host of UI and
control problems. The next game needs to be relatively cheap to make
(not including my time). Being able to reuse existing assets is best,
otherwise I need to be aware of how much extra cost is required and
factor that into to likely earnings. It is a fuzzy line.</p>

<p>The game should be simple to play. Definitely no complex internal
simulation models. It should be clear what is happening on the screen
and quick to learn. This is for two reasons: it is easier to develop;
and, it widens the market of the game. Concealed Intent is complex to
play, and difficult to learn. There is a lot of maths happening “under
the hood”. This greatly decreases the number of people willing to play.
The vast majority of potential players (and press) will only play the
game for a few minutes. If after that time they are still going through
a tutorial explaining mathematical game concepts, most will stop and
never start again. Thus, my next game will just have a couple of simple
game mechanics.</p>

<p>So those are the criteria for evaluating ideas: quick, simple, cheap
(and fun!). With that in mind my long list became a short list of 4. So
I decided to prototype them. Two on paper as the technical complexity is
low, so the gameplay elements are most important. Two in code as the
most challenging part would be the programming. At this stage I don’t
want to talk too much about what each idea actually involves - it is too
soon. Instead, here are photos of each game in progress.</p>

        <p><p>Done. Concealed Intent is now fully released. No longer is it marked
with the stigma of Early Access.</p>

<p>For the next week there is a 34% launch discount on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Steam</a>, and now for the
first time it is also available on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/concealed-intent">Humble
Store</a> too (same
discount).</p>

<p>The success of a modern games tends to be determined in their first
month of release. Visibility, reviews and sales now will result in more
visibility, reviews and sales later. So I’m not too proud to beg… If you
enjoy the game please consider telling people about it and/or writing a
review on Steam. It will all help. Also, if you do see something wrong
in the game, please let me know, the quicker I can find and fix any
issues the better.</p>

<p>Right now I’m also incredibly busy trying to get the word out and
responding to people’s messages. I am way behind. One of the more
interesting things I’m doing is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/4vvrpa/my_game_was_released_today_on_steam_after_years/">Reddit
AMA</a>.
Come along and ask me anything? Everyone who comments (with a question
or otherwise) by Friday 5th August 10:00am GMT will go into the running
to win one of 10 copies of Concealed Intent.</p>

<p>Development work is not over, there will still at least be a version 1.1
update at some point. However, I think the largest part of game is now
complete. Reaching a standard I felt happy about and then saying that
people can pay for it without that Early Access caveat is a huge step.</p>

<p>Having said all that, I would also like to give a huge thank you to
everyone who played Concealed Intent, purchased it, wishlisted/followed
it, or even just checked it out. This game could not have been finished
to this level (or even at all) without your support and feedback. Thank
you!</p>
