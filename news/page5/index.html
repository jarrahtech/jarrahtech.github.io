        <p><p>As expected <a href="/2020/12/14/Progress_Report.html">December was a bad month for progress</a> on my new game. However,
January went much better. All the animations I wanted to add plus some extras have been completed. Of course along the way I thought of some more, but they will be for later. The gameplay UI has been cleaned up and looks reasonable now (for a programmer anyway). As a result the game is now 2-player only (originally it allowed upto 4 players) as I couldn’t work out how to do a nice UI for more players. Also, I fixed some annoying bugs. There are still a couple of bugs outstanding, but nothing that should crash the game.</p>

<centre><a href="/assets/posts/ahb/ahb_20210204.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ahb/ahb_20210204.png" width="550" alt="Abstract Hex Battle WIP" /></a></centre>

<p>We are back in lockdown here in Perth. Based on previous experience this gives me more time, but less productivity. So now is the occasion to start the slow work of cleaning up the menus, screen sizing, tooltips and audio - not hard, just time consuming. Then think about balance and feel, since moving to 2-player has made the gameplay feel flat in places. It needs to be amped  up with various modifiers. I have some ideas.</p>

<p>And the game still needs a name!</p>

<p>Over the next 4 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve balance and feel of the game</li>
  <li>Make the game much prettier and come up with a name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AI, build system &amp; error handling.</li>
</ul>

<p>And after that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare marketing materials &amp; limited buildup with a plan</li>
  <li>Release to testers. Setup on <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> &amp; create a build system</li>
</ul>

        <p><p>I am just back from a fortnight’s holiday on <a href="https://www.australiascoralcoast.com/">WA’s Coral Coast</a>, so time again to look back at what was done and what is coming up.</p>

<p>The couple of months leading up to the holiday were focussed on animations. This has taken much longer than expected, and there are still a couple to be finished, but the hard work has been completed. I have relearnt an important lesson that had been forgotten. Game systems which allow delays in actions for animations to occur are quite different to systems where everything happens instantaneously. Converting from the latter to the former took the unexpected extra time. In future, unless I am developing a definitely throwaway prototype, it will be best to start with the system that can handle delays. Doing that from the start will take much less time overall. There were a couple of other similar things discovered the hard way.</p>

<p>The next two weeks are going to be a write-off for decent work time. Between Christmas, New Years, and some required home maintenance, I doubt much progress will be made. I’ve decided not to stress about this and instead start the next 5 week period from the week after Christmas. Same targets as before.</p>

<p>Over the next 2+5 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish animations.</li>
  <li>AI, build system &amp; error handling.</li>
  <li>Improve balance and feel of the game</li>

        <p><p>Five more weeks done, so how is “Abstract Hex Battle” going? All the originally planned functionality is done, including game progression. Balance is a little better, but the game can descend into a battle of attrition towards the end. I think more balancing and maybe some more powerups are required. The game is looking a lot better now and I’ve started work on various animations.</p>

<centre><a href="/assets/posts/ahb/ahb_wip_20200922.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ahb/ahb_wip_20200922.png" width="550" alt="Abstract Hex Battle WIP" /></a></centre>

<p>There is still so much to do. Now I hope to finish by the end of the year. Especially considering some events I know are coming soon and will absorb a few weeks of attention.</p>

<p>Over the next 4 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete animation, AI, build system &amp; error handling.</li>
  <li>Improve balance and feel of the game</li>
  <li>Make the game much prettier and come up with a name.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Prepare marketing materials &amp; limited buildup with a plan</li>
  <li>Release to testers. Setup on <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> &amp; create a build system</li>
</ul>

<p>When back after a holiday:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Release “Abstract Hex Battle” with initial business plan (squash bugs, cleanup stuff) to Itch.io</li>
</ul>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Last time I wrote about <a href="/2020/08/11/Philosophy.html">why I want to make games</a>. The key takeaway being that I will make games first for myself and secondly for an audience. That will greatly inform my initial business model, which is detailed here. I should mention that this is not necessarily a forever plan - I may tweak, change or completely abandon it as time and circumstances change.</p>

<p>I believe the main reason my first attempt at gamedev <a href="/2016/10/17/Release-Postmortem.html">failed financially</a> is that the game took too long to develop. Concealed Intent, was not a hit, so did not make enough money to cover its costs and my living expenses during its over 4 years of development. If I was able to finish it in under a year, then the situation would have been much closer to sustainable. Now I know more about gamedev, and what a solo dev can reasonably achieve. My next games will be smaller and simpler. If I can make two games per year with each making on average about half (or a little less) than Concealed Intent, then I should be fine.</p>

<p>So how do I manage this? The reason why I suggest two per year, and not one per year is because I want to maximise the chances for a hit. I plan to produce decent small games stripped down to the gameplay basics. The problem is limited resources. As a solo dev creating a fully featured game will still likely take well over a year with all the usual extras expected by customers and marketing time. If it is not a hit, then it will not recover is expenses. Smaller, simpler games can be turned out much faster, and if they do badly, well there is another coming soon after. A fail-fast system. If they do well then more time and effort can be applied with a greater chance of success. I’ll throw up lots of ideas and see which get traction.</p>

<p>The games will be kept small by: keeping them 2D or fixed camera; singleplayer only (no online play); PC only; minimising story (but some <a href="https://emshort.blog/2019/11/29/storylets-you-want-them/">storylets</a> are ok); using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">proc-gen</a> over handcrafted levels; and reusing old assets. I will aim for an “interesting” graphical style - ideas will be prioritised over graphics. If further development is warranted then all of the above can be revisited. Plus extras that may include better AI, daily challenges/scoreboards, better graphics/UI/SFX, more configuration options, modding support, wider platform support, more content, accessibility, internationalisation/localisation, DLC, etc. If the smaller game does not sell well enough to become a larger game (which I expect most will not) then no extra effort will be applied and I’ll move onto the next one.</p>

<p>With time, the speed of developing these smaller games will improve as better, reusable tools are created and my skills increase. I should also hopefully learn more about what is desired by the community, so just make better designed and marketable games from the start.</p>

<p>Time to keep going until I find something …</p>

<p>Next, what comes next, the Roadmap (coming soon).</p>

        <p><p>Another 5 weeks done, but with slow progress. The plan was to have Abstract Hex Battle largely complete. It is not. There is a little more to do with progression mechanics, balance and animations. The plan now is to do all those plus the AI during this 5 week block. The delay is caused by a week of low productivity, another week given over to tax and other life problems, and more time than expected on the (hopefully) common tools. On the plus side I did manage to write the 3 blog posts (here is the first on <a href="/2020/08/11/Philosophy.html">The Philosophy of Jarrah Technology</a>).</p>

<p>Over the next 5 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstract Hex Battle should be complete. Including AI, full game progression mechanics &amp;  animations.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the 5 weeks after should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any last minute prettying up of the game and bugfixes.</li>
  <li>Release (probably to <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> initially)</li>
</ul>

  <br/>
        <p><p>Now that I have <a href="/2020/04/06/Again.html">restarted Jarrah Technology</a>, I think it is important to set down some clear principles. Essentially a guiding philosophy on why I am a gamedev; how I want to proceed; and what sort of games I want to create. This should help when the inevitable difficult decisions need to be made, or at a minimum help prevent being side-tracked. I might as well make it public to keep me honest. This will be split into two parts: one with the fundamental ideas unlikely to change (presented here); and another post to derive the business model (which may change later).</p>

<p>To start - why become a gamedev? Mostly because it is something I enjoy and something I can do. I want to work for myself and create. Software development is my main skill, thus any plan will probably involve computers. There are paths other than games with similar results - I could work on startups or as an <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">indie hacker</a>. However, I have experience writing games. I know what is required. It is possible to do by myself if necessary. Importantly, I know I can enjoy the gamedev process. So I will start with games.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@kitfoxgames/8-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-starting-a-games-studio-e390a713a7d8">Creating a successful game studio</a> <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/KarlKontus/20200710/366187/Can_you_be_a_full_time_solo_indie_developer.php">is difficult</a> and often results in failure - even for those with profitable games. I want my games to make money (maybe even dream about it), but it is not the primary goal. I am lucky to be in a position where I don’t need much income for a while to live acceptably.  This means I will work on the games I want to work on, but at the same time will not try to work too much on a single title. I will aim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast">“fail-fast”</a>. This will hopefully maximise my chance at a hit (relatively) and maintain my attention. Still, in the end I must remember I am creating games first for myself, and secondly for a potential audience. I am not opposed to working in a team and/or publishers, as long as it fits in with this mindset (which I suspect would make it difficult).</p>

<p>What sort of game do I want to make? Basically, the sort of game I find myself returning to repeatedly. Games that present the player with <a href="http://www.wargamespace.com/2014/05/05/geryk-analysis-wargaming/">interesting choices</a>. I want players to be leaning forward and thinking. This means they are likely to be slower games - fast reactions will not be required and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actions_per_minute">actions-per-minute</a> will not be an important statistic.</p>

<p>Thus the genres I will focus on are: management games; simulation games; (computer) cardgames; (computer) boardgames; and, strategy/tactical games. Maybe with a little grand strategy and rogue-like in there too. Platformers, action games, adventure games, RPGs and FPS’s will be avoided. I will also be unlikely to work on puzzle games just out of personal preference, despite them fitting my requirements. The initial target is the PC single-player audience. Other platforms or play modes may come later. Definitely no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">F2P</a>. I’ll aim for 4-10 hours of gameplay, but with some replayability. I don’t want players to feel overwhelmed by the game. I would prefer to make an good impression then leave, rather than stretching the game too thinly.</p>

<p>I saw a video that suggested <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kg3NbqHrAU">“good players create strategies, average players see paths to victory, while weak players chase luck”</a>. On this measure, I foresee mainly developing for average players. It would be nice to move towards strategies, but I recognise the level of work to achieve this might be beyond my timeframe for each game. What does this mean? The games should have some component of luck resulting in variance of result, but the result should never be random - best is when the player can know what mistakes were made. I will try to avoid too much luck and aim for <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1294990/input-vs-output-randomness">output rather than input randomness</a> (where possible). The games are unlikely to be big in-depth simulations (war or otherwise). I will aim to simplify the complex. Some thought and strategy should be necessary to win regularly, but there should be no need to study.</p>

<p>Next, how I plan to make money, the <a href="/2020/09/23/Business-Model.html">Business Model</a>.</p>

        <p><p>Work is progressing on prototypes. Report complete.</p>

<p>Ok, that is not enough. Several months ago I wrote that I had <a href="/2020/04/06/Again.html">restarted game development</a>. What has happened since then? Well, I have split my time into 5-week blocks, and have just finished the 3rd. It was at this point I had hoped to have the first prototype complete and released. However, as is always the case, things have taken longer than expected. I am now hoping to be finished and released in two more 5-week blocks. Although there is a potential problem with making that date - I suspect the AI will be harder than I had planned.</p>

<p>The game I decided to create is code-named “Abstract Hex Battle” - one of the tasks remaining is to come up with a better name! The idea was it should be a simple 2D game that I did not care too much about. Something that could serve as a way to test myself while creating  development tools and a routine. At the start, things went well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ahb/ahb_20200722.png" alt="Abstract Hex Battle WIP 20200722" title="Abstract Hex Battle WIP 20200722" /></p>

<p>It took just 4 weeks to get the basic game loop running. Then work slowed as I lost 3 of the last 11 weeks to non-gamedev work. I have also realised that despite being intentionally throwaway, I am not happy to release a game without some polish. So everything is taking longer than expected. This is something I will need to think about, as if I continue to polish my prototypes, then it is likely I will only be able to manage around 2 a year. At that point they are becoming more like little games than prototypes.</p>

<p>On the positive side, over the last couple of blocks I have created a number of (hopefully) reusable tools. That should make future games faster to develop. There are a couple more tools I think are required. Here is the plan.</p>

<p>Over the next 5 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstract Hex Battle should be complete except for AI. This means game progression mechanics &amp; unlocks; balance; animations; and common tools should be complete.</li>
  <li>Prepare 3 blog/mail articles on: the philosophy of Jarrah Technology Games; the business plan; and the road map.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the 5 weeks after should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a decent AI.</li>
  <li>Any last minute prettying up of the game and bugfixes.</li>
  <li>Release (probably to <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> initially)</li>
</ul>

<p>I will update again in 5 weeks.</p>

        <p><p>The world is in a state of flux, and so is my life. As of last week, I am no longer employed at Substantive Research. Also 6 months ago I moved back to my hometown: Perth, Australia. The plan is to take this opportunity to try creating games again. I started prototyping new ideas this Monday. These new games will be smaller than Concealed Intent, but still in the strategy/tactics genre, as that is what I enjoy. I do not plan on any future significant work on Concealed Intent. If there is a bug I will fix it, but otherwise that game is done.</p>

<p>In the next month or so, I plan to reactivate my communication channels (including this blog) and let people know what is happening properly.</p>
