      <p>Work is progressing on prototypes. Report complete.</p>

<p>Ok, that is not enough. Several months ago I wrote that I had <a href="/2020/04/06/Again.html">restarted game development</a>. What has happened since then? Well, I have split my time into 5-week blocks, and have just finished the 3rd. It was at this point I had hoped to have the first prototype complete and released. However, as is always the case, things have taken longer than expected. I am now hoping to be finished and released in two more 5-week blocks. Although there is a potential problem with making that date - I suspect the AI will be harder than I had planned.</p>

<p>The game I decided to create is code-named “Abstract Hex Battle” - one of the tasks remaining is to come up with a better name! The idea was it should be a simple 2D game that I did not care too much about. Something that could serve as a way to test myself while creating  development tools and a routine. At the start, things went well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ahb/ahb_20200722.png" alt="Abstract Hex Battle WIP 20200722" title="Abstract Hex Battle WIP 20200722" /></p>

<p>It took just 4 weeks to get the basic game loop running. Then work slowed as I lost 3 of the last 11 weeks to non-gamedev work. I have also realised that despite being intentionally throwaway, I am not happy to release a game without some polish. So everything is taking longer than expected. This is something I will need to think about, as if I continue to polish my prototypes, then it is likely I will only be able to manage around 2 a year. At that point they are becoming more like little games than prototypes.</p>

<p>On the positive side, over the last couple of blocks I have created a number of (hopefully) reusable tools. That should make future games faster to develop. There are a couple more tools I think are required. Here is the plan.</p>

<p>Over the next 5 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstract Hex Battle should be complete except for AI. This means game progression mechanics &amp; unlocks; balance; animations; and common tools should be complete.</li>
  <li>Prepare 3 blog/mail articles on: the philosophy of Jarrah Technology Games; the business plan; and the road map.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the 5 weeks after should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a decent AI.</li>
  <li>Any last minute prettying up of the game and bugfixes.</li>
  <li>Release (probably to <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> initially)</li>
</ul>

<p>I will update again in 5 weeks.</p>
