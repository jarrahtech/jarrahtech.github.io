      <p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed Intent is 33% off</a>
as part of the Steam Winter sale until the 4th January.</p>

<p>It has been just over a month since Concealed Intent’s release onto
Steam Early Access. Sales have been lower than expected, but then my
marketing has been lacking in effort more than expected too, so there is
no basis for complaint. My time instead has been spent on improving the
game - with definite results. The initial EA release was version 0.9.16.
Today I released 0.9.20. Tons of (minor) bugs are fixed and many
cosmetic improvements made. Furthermore, on entering EA, there were 4
features that needed to be completed before a full release: 4 new
missions; Steam Achievements; a focus point for online duels; and, being
able to challenge your friends online.</p>

<p>With the 0.9.20 release, all the original goals for EA are now complete!
This release specifically adds the ability to challenge a friend on
Steam. Players can also choose the ship type, the map and the time limit
for submitting turns (defaults to 7 days, but can range from 30 minutes
to 30 days). Hopefully this will fix the previous problems of online
match-making and a few duels will get started. It is also a large change
to the underlying code base - it has been a busy month.</p>

<a href="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_action.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/challenge_action.png" width="400" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Does this mean I’m done and ready for a full release? Definitely not.
Apart from the inevitable bug fixes, there are a few more things to be
done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Skirmish features - the most requested feature among the community
is more detailed skirmishes. So , this will be the major piece of
work addressed next. Part of it it will be fairly straightforward,
but the implications of those changes to the AI will be the real
challenge. The enemies will have to get a lot smarter to handle all
the options, at the moment they would just become confused.</li>
  <li>UI &amp; UX improvements - there are a few inconsistencies and
annoyances - these should be ironed out.</li>
  <li>Performance - I’ve noticed a few skipped frames on my (5 year old)
PC. This shouldn’t happen and I will find and fix the problem.</li>
  <li>Missions and tutorial rework (plus balance) - Watching people play
suggests that the early missions are still problematic - either too
easy or too hard. Need to spend some more time on this.</li>
  <li>Marketing - really should get going on this task!!!</li>
</ul>

<p>But all that will have to wait a little, as apart from a few marketing
tasks (and assuming the latest release doesn’t have a breaking bug) I’m
taking the rest of the year off. My first break since May.</p>
