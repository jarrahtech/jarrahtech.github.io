      <p>Among Gamasutra bloggers there appears to be a common tradition of
detailing the methods employed to successfully pass through Steam
Greenlight. Often these blogs amaze the reader with stunningly short
periods of time in purgatory (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChadAta/20150311/238454/20_Days_on_Steam_Greenlight.php">20
days</a>,
<a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/PatrickCorrieri/20150417/241354/Greenlit_in_7_days_one_games_journey.php">7
days</a>,
or the best I’ve seen, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SvyatoslavCherkasov/20150130/235409/How_to_get_greenlit_in_5_days.php">5
days</a>).
I’ve devoured these tutorials and tried to follow their instructions.
The result? My game, Concealed Intent, took just under 100 days to pass
through Greenlight, and I have no idea how this was achieved.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/greenlit.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/greenlit.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Most of the other games’ posts make useful suggestions. Use animated
gifs to catch a browser’s attention. Have a good and short trailer (90
seconds or under). Use BBCode to include images in well organised
description text. Basically assume that people coming to your Greenlight
page will be looking for a few seconds before moving onto the next one.
You need to quickly attract their attention long enough for them to
spend a few more seconds to vote “Yes”. All this advice was followed on
the Concealed Intent page. I think it paid off - 42% of people voted
“Yes” (compared to a top 50 average of 26% at the time of being
greenlit). Of course, converting visitors into “Yes” votes is only half
the equation.</p>

<p>You first need to get people to visit your game’s page. I would guess on
the order of 1000-&gt;2000 people came
through Steam itself to my page, mostly in the first week while it still
appeared on the front page of Greenlight. About 70% of people vote and
if 40% of those are converted to “Yes” votes, then the total is
300-&gt;500 - still a long way from the top 100 (at present just
under 2000 votes). Here suggestions range from contacting all your
friends, posting screenshots to twitter (don’t forget the hashtags!),
and just continually pushing a media presence. It is hard work and takes
up a great deal of time. As a sole developer, I found myself having to
choose between promotion and development. In the end I just oscillated
between the two doing neither job properly.</p>

<p>One method of promotion I did not use (and I think this had a large
impact on being greenlit) is bundling or key giveaways. Valve has stated
that <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/564958453505196032">promising keys for votes is
discouraged</a>.
However, a number of organisations will offer to help get games through
Greenlight and their plan is generally to giveaway or sell the game
cheaply while asking the receiver to vote “Yes” (which is clearly in
their interest). The effect can be impressive (see
<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JeremyDavis/20150427/241973/Project_Tarvotan__Our_Greenlight_Story.php">here</a>
and
<a href="http://aerosquest.com/development/aeros-quest-has-been-greenlit-the-story-the-campaign-and-the-stats-revealed/">here</a>).
An anecdotal survey of games in a bundle showed that most were greenlit
within a fortnight of the sale starting. So it works, and fast. There
are arguments to be made that such techniques are not in violation of
Valve’s policy, but I believe it is against the spirit of Greenlight so
I avoided them.</p>

<p>So how did I drive people to the Concealed Intent Greenlight page? I
didn’t. At least not successfully in any meaningful numbers. I used
Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, IndieDB. I kept blogs on my own websites and
Gamasutra and TIGSource. By the end of the campaign I had around 2250
visitors and 690 votes, corresponding to around 42% of the way to the
top 100. I was about to shift back into big PR push when the email
arrived saying I had been greenlit. Thank you, thank you, thank you to
whomever at Valve decided Concealed Intent was worthy!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/unbalanced.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/unbalanced.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Originally I thought Greenlight was to prove a market exists for your
game - thus the need for a large number of votes. Now I think the
purpose of Greenlight is to avoid “bad” games? So it is not about
building a market, so much as catching the attention of Valve’s Steam
custodians (with Greenlight a better way of doing this than the old
system of emailing and bothering Valve until accepted onto the
platform). Getting lots of votes is still the most likely way of
achieving this, but not the only way.</p>

<p>So my advice? For what it’s worth, I think the best plan is to produce a
polished game, find real customers and avoid selling out cheaply. If the
game doesn’t immediately take off on Greenlight, do not be disheartened - instead grind it out over time with continual PR. Of course, all this
assumes you have a good game - that should be your first and main goal!</p>
