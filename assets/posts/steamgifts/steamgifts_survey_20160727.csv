Event activity compared to previous non-marketed results was almost the same. Group membership raised by 10-20 users only while GA had thousands of entries. Most of low level public users on SG don't read descriptions thus I believe it's not good for marketing (maybe beside marketing the very game that is being given away).

Making giveaways for [edited] (from 50 to 133 copies) on SteamGifts I've noticed a big increase on wishlist additions, and a good % of those have turned into a buy later (my own wishlist turned into buys are around 20%). Can't tell how much its from SG, but SG its my main source of advertising together with bundles so I assume its at least 50%. And for each 50 copies I giveaway, I notice 2-3 new reviews days after the giveaway ends. And assuming that something like 50 out of 500 of buyers write reviews, I guess its a good number. Can't tell if its all influence of SteamGifts, but as myself often add games to wishlist because I saw them on SteamGifts, I assume its a positive result and because of SG. Also, this is a userbase for people wanting to win games, so if you can take awareness from it, and buyers, its a potential target audience that aims for new games. SG is full of collectors and people wanting someting new. Specially if you plan to have a sale or add your game to a bundle. I often check the stats page of my game, and I can assume SteamGifts has been helpful on increasing awareness of my game. And as a user, I often buy games because I met them on SteamGifts. Games I would never heard of otherwise. In short, this is a target audience composed by people that leech and people who buys. Who buys, will keep an eye to your game in the future, if in an sale or in a bundle, and it the more they see it in SteamGits, more they will want to have in the future. For the leechers, they will be pleased to win and it can result in a review. As I made giveaways for other developers in the past, I strongly recommend SteamGifts for: Newly released games, to increase awareness; and cheap games, for the same reason. In the last case, it can result in imediate buy. In the first case, it can result in a buy in the future. It may not be a good platform for games released some time ago, unless the game didn't have a proper marketing campaign for release."
