      <p>I’m just back from a month-long overseas holiday. So no signiticant work has been done since the last report, and the coming month will be
spent getting back up to speed. That is the progress report, but …</p>

<p>While I was away Unity announced a new pricing policy, suffered a huge developer backlash, and then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/unity-software-rolls-back-parts-new-pricing-policy-after-backlash-2023-09-22/">rolled most of it back</a>. The important change was the addition a of a per-install fee on all Unity games, even those that were made under a previous versions of Unity (which supposedly have unchangeable terms &amp; conditions). There were also concerns around what counted as an install and how it would be measured. The rollback has kept the per-install fee, but removed the retroactivity and added a high install hurdle before fees accrue. The impression is that many developers feel this is good enough. I don’t.</p>

<p>I have two Unity games available. Both Concealed Intent and SpaceHexDuel are written using Unity v5, first released in 2015 and last updated in 2019. Both were released long before these new fees were announced and both are far from clearing the install hurdle. So they should be safe from Unity’s capriciousness. However, the idea that Unity could change the terms of the agreement I had with them from nearly 10 years ago (when I purchased the engine, there has been no money or purchases since) just removes any trust I have in them. Honestly, fuck Unity!</p>

<p>Luckily, I have a small headstart on abandoning Unity - thus the smugness. Back in April <a href="https://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2023/04/03/Annoyance.html">I wrote how I was too annoyed by Unity to keep using it</a>. After a brief dalliance with Three.js I decided to use Babylon.js as my new engine. Since then I haven’t gotten far due to various distractions (like being out of the country for a month). Now there is a flood of devs away from Unity and most seem to be going to Godot. Did I make the right choice? I don’t know. Time to create some prototypes to find out!</p>
