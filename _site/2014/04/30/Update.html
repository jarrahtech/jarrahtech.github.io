      <p>Recently I have started showing Concealed Intent to people in person.
Watching people play provides a huge amount of information far beyond
their verbal suggestions. It also results in immediate feedback rather
than waiting weeks for email responses. In person playthroughs are
definitely the way to go in the early stages of game development. So
far, it has been shown to a couple of game developers I met at
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/01/global-game-jam-2014.html">GGJ14</a>
and many people at a local <a href="https://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a> meetup.</p>

<p>The feedback has been roughly as expected. No gushing, but nothing
hugely negative either. There has been at least one “this is like
”Homeworld“:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld” comment, which I
count as a huge compliment. It has been some time since last hearing
people say they don’t understand what is happening in the game.
Hopefully the game has reached a reasonable level of complexity (I
recently removed the “percentage chance of hitting” stat, now the change
of hitting an enemy with your lasers is equal to your lock on them).
Many ideas, changes and improvements have been suggested - some I agree
with, some I don’t.</p>

<p>The most common subject of comments is now the GUI. Definitely much more
work is required here. Below is the current state of the GUI, as
designed completely by me.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP_20140430.png"><img src="/assets/posts/ci/ConcealedIntent_WIP_20140430.png" title="Work In Progress" width="512" alt="Work In Progress" /></a></p>

<p>The GUI has been made a little more user-friendly. Fonts and icons now
resize themselves to match the screensize. No more squinting at a mass
of tiny text. Hull integrity and noise are now shown graphically on the
unit list. Colours can be changed in the options menu. Text has a black
outline for readability and most items have tooltips. A grid can be
displayed to aid understanding where objects are in space.</p>

<p>Still there is much to do. Firstly it is ugly, especially the icons.
There are also regular requests for a stats display. Although, I can’t
see where to put it. There are many options for improving it and I have
many ideas of my own in addition to other’s ideas. The problem is I
can’t imagine how they will work or look without just making the changes
in the game itself. As a result forward progress is very slow.</p>

<p>Also at the IDGA meetup I spoke to a few artists and professional game
developers. Originally my plan was to only hire artists once the game
was largely complete and just live with placeholder art until that time.
However, the amount of time spent on the GUI could be drastically
reduced with a bit of decent artistic guidance. I now think it may be
worth hiring an artist to design the GUI and then code to their result.
Surely they can design better and faster than me! This will free up time
for the backend coding tasks to which my skills best apply. Also, the
time taken to create artwork needs to be considered. If some can be
produced concurrently with the programming rather than sequentially,
that can only speed final completion (and I will finish!). While the
story is still a work-in-progress, it is still premature to create 3D
models and backgrounds. However, the basic gameplay is settling down, so
it may be well worthwhile getting someone professional to work on the
GUI and menus.</p>

<p>I also talked to a few people about how to hire freelance artists and
have a couple of contacts to follow-up. All the GUI tasks have been
dropped from my to-do list and replaced by writing a GUI scope document
and finding an artist. Also, there are a few minor engine tweaks,
followed by the big tasks of starting to write an online game server and
save/replay files.</p>
