      <p>It’s alive. I mean it is live. This morning I set Concealed Intent to
“published” on Steam Early Access. As the page informing me of success
suggested: “insert confetti here”. If you go to the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">Steam Store
page</a> or the big Steam widget
on the <a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">games webpage</a> it is possible to
pay actual real money for it. It feels very weird that people might do
so (not many though after just a couple of hours:).</p>

<p>Of course, the game is not finished. Not by a long way. This is more of
a start than an end. Hopefully the feedback more players will provide
will help make the game better. Already I have seen a number of good
suggestions (from prerelease copies) - and no bugs yet!</p>

<p>There are four things I really want to get done before release (but
Steam says not to promise anything, so these are not promises!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 extra single-player campaign missions</li>
  <li>Steam achievements</li>
  <li>A focus point for online duels to prevent two stealth players never
finding each other</li>
  <li>Being able to challenge your Steam friends to a game with custom time
limits, rather than random match-making with whomever is online, which
is probably no one :(</li>
</ul>

<p>After those four I’ll hopefully have time to add more features as
prioritised by the community.</p>

<p>There have also been a couple of YouTube Let’s Play videos posted.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=limV-arFiRA">Negative Root - Sneak Peek Concealed
Intent</a> (English) - first 5
missions</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9QFj8qpZUI">Daraton - FIRST LOOK OF The Concealed
Intent</a> (Deutsch|German) -
tutorial and first two introductory missions</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of YouTube and prerelease copies. As mentioned in the previous
post, I’m getting a ton of key requests. Strangely, today is the first
day I haven’t woken up to 10+ key requests. On average I refuse 80-90%.
Usually because: a large number of keys are requested; the email address
is unverifiable; the requester has no videos in the last month; I don’t
see any similar games reviewed; or, they have very few views (I look for
around 80-100+ views on videos a few weeks old). I’m not sure if any of
this is normal, but in the Steam discussion groups many gamedevs seem
regretful of profligate key giveaways. However, I’m still checking all
of them taking 5-10 minutes each.</p>

<p>That adds up. With all the other little unexpected release tasks, the
time allotted to development has greatly suffered in the last week. I’ve
probably only managed the equivalent of two previous workdays progress
over the last 8 days.</p>

<p>Oh, and one last pro tip. Upload your game music to YouTube as private
videos well before your release date, to ensure people without any
rights haven’t somehow managed to “claim” your music! This happened to
me and wrecked my weekend as YouTuber’s will not post videos of games so
encumbered. Lucky, it is all fixed now and the copyright is back where
it belongs.</p>

<p>Now back to emails and hopefully some dev work too. And definitely not
hitting refresh button on the sales report, no, no, no…</p>
