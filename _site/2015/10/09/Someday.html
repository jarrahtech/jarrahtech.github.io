      <p>It has been a while since I last updated everyone on Concealed Intent’s
progress. This is not because little has been happening - quite the
opposite! I have been working so much almost everything else has fallen
away - most notably exercise and keeping up with people. In the last
week I’ve left the house twice, both times just to buy food. It is
crunch time on the project, but since this is a one-person project, I’m
doing it to myself and have no one else to blame. However, today a major
goal was “finished” (in quotes as it is never really finished), so I
have a little downtime. Partly this is because Unity has said they may
release fix for a bug that has plagued me the last fortnight, and I
decided to wait a little for it before releasing the latest build. There
is a workaround for the bug, but that has its own issues. So here’s
hoping that they do fix it and soon!</p>

<p>Since the start of September more online functionality, a soundtrack, a
modular narrative system, random skirmish generation, a splash screen
and various bug fixes have been added to the game. However, the biggest
change is to the controls, GUI and tutorial. By mid September, I was
feeling quite confident in the quality of Concealed Intent and began
planning to put it on Steam. First there was to be the final playtests.
Unfortunately, those playtests did not go well. The general view was
that it was hard to tell what was going on in the tute, the game broke
certain conventions and there was just too much clicking. Oh well. I was
in quite the funk for a few days afterwards, wondering if the game was a
failure. Recovery came through talking to a couple of local gamedevs
(thanks guys!) and now the GUI has greatly changed - movement and
targeting can be done with a single click, sub panels (noise, components
&amp; log) have been removed, the tutorial completely rewritten and a
selection indicator added.</p>

<p>Now once again I think the game is ready for Steam Early Access. If its
not, I’ll probably just release it anyway because I can’t keep working
on this game forever. It must end soon. There is the “workaround”
version on dropbox now (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">available
here</a>).
hopefully to be replaced with the fixed version soon. Then it is time to
put this version out for comments. Then I’ll work to get a private beta
on Steam (sending keys to all those that have helped along the way),
while at the same time improving my (nearly non-existent) marketing
materials - including this website.</p>
