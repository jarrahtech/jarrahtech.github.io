      <p>I’m back from the three day <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a> Unity3D
conference in Amsterdam. I have put my notes from the sessions up at my
personal blog. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/08/unite12-day-1.html">Day One is here</a> and the
other days are linked from there.</p>

<p>Overall, the conference was a good experience and worth the trip. Going
certainly engendered a sense that Unity3D is a safe choice for game
development. There was a surprisingly large number of attendees. Also
some big name games were produced using the tool, including the AAA and
well-reviewed <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/endless-space">Endless Space</a> - a game not
entirely disimilar to Concealed Intent. The demos of Unity4 looked
particularly impressive. I don’t think a small Unity developer like me
need to overly worry about performance as the tool is obviously plenty
fast enough. I learnt a great deal from the talks, often leaving
inspired and wishing I had my full development environment available to
start coding immediately. In particular, Concealed Intent may soon have
camera movement very similar to <a href="http://universesandbox.com/">Universe Sandbox</a>, make use of structs for memory
management and I now see a need to learn more about custom shaders
(everyone’s doing it).</p>

<p>I also had my eyes opened to the business side of game development. I
perhaps went to the conference too early for maximum business benefit,
but then I didn’t know that until attending. It is best to go to a
conference with a purpose and a message. That could be finding a
publisher, advertising for contract work or just making connections. I
just went to see what was happening and perhaps appeared as a
dilletante, just trying out game development for fun. That is not the
situation, but disproving it requires finishing Concealed Intent (or at
least getting very close to finishing).</p>

<p>Onward!</p>
