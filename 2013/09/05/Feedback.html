      <p>It has been nearly 5 weeks since my last update. This corresponds to 5
weeks since an alpha build was sent out for testing and 5 weeks since
any development work on Concealed Intent. So what has been happening?
There has been the wait for feedback from testers and much thinking
about future work. I have also been replaying Frozen Synapse (one of the
inspirations for Concealed Intent) and other turn-based games.</p>

<p>Based on feedback and fresher memories of Frozen Synapse, I think it is
time to go in a different direction. Frozen Synapse is more complex and
frustrating than I remember (though it is still a good game). Adding the
3rd dimension and a “fog of war” mechanic to the mix has made Concealed
Intent too complex. The plan is now to make the game’s core mechanics
simpler. Stealth and 3D are essential to the concept, so they will stay.
Instead, targeting then firing when a certain hit probability is
exceeded will be replaced by ships shooting on explicit command. The
ability to rewind/replay will also be removed. Just these two changes
will make the internal simulation far simpler and should address the big
issues raised by testers. There will be a number of other smaller
changes too, including a reorganisation of the GUI. The result is
hopefully a more intuitive playing experience.</p>

<p>The testing experience has not gone as I expected. The alpha build was
only sent to people who had said, in person, they would like to test the
game. Despite this I was prepared to consider a response rate of around
40% as a huge success (defining response as saying that they at least
played it). The actual response rate barely breaks into two digits and
has taken far longer than hoped. I’d like to believe this is because
people have been too busy to try the game out. However, I suspect a few
people played it and didn’t like it, and so decided not to respond
(despite that sort of feedback being vital). Next time a build is ready
for some testing I definitely won’t try the same system again, but I’m
not sure how to replace.</p>
