      <p>It is time to decloak. For some time I have been developing the indie
game Concealed Intent. After years as an IT consultant, my circumstances
changed and it was time to try something different. The game has largely
been developed by myself, with the much appreciated help of a freelance
artist in the last few months.</p>

<p>As obscurity seems to be the indie gamedev’s greatest enemy boss,
introverted tendencies must be overcome. So that is why I’m writing this
blog. In future posts I’ll write on lessons learnt (both technical and
otherwise) as well as detail the last push towards completion, but first
some introductions.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent is a turn-based game of tactical space combat. Players
control their ships in a completely 3D world - hunting down their
enemies, just as they are being hunted themselves! In Concealed Intent
you know your enemies are out there, but not exactly where, or even what
they are. The fun comes from out-thinking your opponent rather than any
test of reaction speed.</p>

<p>The core gameplay mechanic is stealth. But how can you be stealthy in
space? Well, space is big and empty. Finding something can be like
looking for a needle in a haystack. On the other hand, there is nowhere
for the needle to hide - to stay concealed it needs to fade into the
background as much as possible. Nearly anything a ship does will signal
its presence and increase the ability of those around to detect it. A
big ship may blot out stars as it passes. Heat from engines can be
detected against the cold of the void. Lasers can be traced back to
their origin. Eventually as detection increases, a firing solution can
be calculated so that a beam of coherent light a few millimetres in
diameter can cross thousands of kilometres to strike an evasive enemy -
hidden no longer!</p>

<p>To defeat your enemies you need to devise a range of strategies to gain
enough information to successfully shoot at them. All the while they are
trying to do the same to you. Various equipment is available to help
both sides, including sensors, countermeasures and drones. There will be
a single-player campaign, instant procedural skirmishes and online
multiplayer.</p>

<p>Concealed Intent has been the last two years of my life and it is
finally nearing completion. Time to start telling people it exists! (or
will very soon exist at least). By the way if the screenshot reminded
you of Homeworld, well done, that game is definitely an inspiration. If
you read the description and thought of submarines, well spotted, the
original name of the game was space submarine!</p>
