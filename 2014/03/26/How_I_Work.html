      <p>A recent Gamasutra blog posted about <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EthanLevy/20140320/213611/Escaping_the_Indie_Shame_Spiral.php">Escaping the Indie Shame
Spiral</a>.
It described ways to prioritise work and get stuff done. I work in a
similar manner and decided to detail it here.</p>

<p>The article talks about using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> or Pivotal
Tracker to record tasks and the speed of work completed. I started using
Trello; it is a great product, for an online todo list. However, as a
lone developer, the friction of typing tasks and updating progress was
not worth the benefits. No one else needs to coordinate their work with
mine and I can largely keep the state of the project in my head. Trello
was just acting as a backup and reminder for those “nice to do, but not
vital” tasks that always seem to be done when there is time (which is
rarely).</p>

<p>Instead I keep my task list on paper. Since I use a standing desk for
coding, a notebook is laid down open at normal desk height. I can look
down and see what needs to be done next. If there is something to be
added or completed I just lean down and scribble it down or scratch it
out. Very little effort is required - thoughts are quickly translated to
text. I also keep paper around to work through coding problems or sketch
out designs, again very easy and low friction. The downside is that I
need to transcribe the task list every couple of weeks as the pages are
filled. Although, that often reminds me of some of the lower priority
tasks that might otherwise be forgotten. Here is my todo list (the left
page in the large notebook) and notes (all the other pages) as they
stand today .</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ci/notes.jpg" alt="Notes" title="Notes" /></p>

<p>The Gamasutra article also mentions using commitments as deadlines and
motivation to complete tasks. A great idea. My original commitments were
<a href="/2013/09/05/Feedback/">alpha testing</a> (completed) and
<a href="/2014/03/09/Past_Deadline/">GDC</a> (abandoned). The article has reminded
me to set some more! So here they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show local gamedevs - I’ve met a few other game developers here in
KL. I’ll treat them to lunch if they don’t mind taking a quick look
at Concealed Intent during the meal and giving me their first
impressions. I can do the same for any game they are working on. I
should be in a position to send out invites in a day or two - just
need to get it working on my Mac laptop (as opposed to my
development PC).</li>
  <li>IGDA Malaysia Sharing Session on April 25th - in a month the local
IGDA chapter is holding a sharing session. I’ll take Concealed
Intent along. The target for this session will be a better, smoother
GUI.</li>
  <li>Reddit r/gamedev Feedback Friday - I hadn’t heard of this until
reading the article. I should give it a go (and give the other games
feedback too). For this I’d want most of the gameplay options
available (perhaps omitting online play) - probably still a couple
of months away.</li>
  <li>Alpha test (again).</li>
</ul>
