      <p>I have created a self-imposed deadline - next years
<a href="http://www.gdconf.com">GDC</a>. Target acquired! It is all organised and
booked. Now Concealed Intent needs to be largely finished before it
starts on the 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2015. So what is the progress so far…</p>

<p>Creating the story for the single player campaign is finished. There are
10 main missions, plus a tutorial, plus an epilogue. The plan is that
hopefully this should total around 4-5 hours of gameplay for a new
player. However, work on balance and enemy AI still needs to be done to
ensure this (the game is too fast and not stealthy enough at the
moment). Working out the story allows me to start creating the maps and
the ships (with appropriate components). That allows me to look at
hiring a 3D artist to create nice in-game representations for them.</p>

<p>On other art, the menu work has begun. I can only hope that it has as
large an effect on player perceptions as improving the GUI. The menu
work is being done by the same artist as the GUI. It was nice to meet
them to finish up the GUI work. They suggested fewer fixes and changes
than I had expected. Also, they expressed excitement about seeing their
designs in the game and being able to play it too (plus their name was
already in the credits). I found that exciting too - I feel more
confident that the game is good.</p>

<p>I’m also starting to plan for when the game is complete and I need to
start selling it. Obscurity is likely to be the biggest problem. There
are many good indie games out there and the main task will be to let
people know mine even exists. Part of that plan is to publish to social
media more often - including blogs. However, that does not not
necessarily mean this blog. There are other sites like Gamasutra that
more people read. I will start writing a series of posts to introduce
Concealed Intent and post them wherever I can - including here.</p>

<p>I’d better get started!</p>
