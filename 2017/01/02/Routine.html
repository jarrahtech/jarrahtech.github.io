      <p>With a new year, it is time to evaluate how Jarrah Technology is
progressing and determine a plan for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Concealed Intent</strong></p>

<p>My first game, Concealed Intent, was fully released on Steam at the
beginning of August. Since then there have been a few minor bugfix
releases and one major (1.1) update which included Linux support.
Reviews are generally positive, players on the
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/374150/discussions/">forums</a> are great,
although sales have been slow. Below is an updated graph of revenue vs
costs from my <a href="/2016/10/17/Release-Postmortem/">postmortem</a>. Revenue
will probably stagnate over the next few months as the effect of
numerous platform sales subside. Valuing my time at zero (never a good
idea), the game should be profitable before mid-year. Not awful, but not
a great result.</p>

<p>Work on Concealed Intent is now slowing. There are a handful of very
minor fixes to be applied plus a few additions to skirmish and campaign
play. It is probably not reasonable to try extensive modification to
improve its popularity. It is a niche game, with a correspondingly small
audience. Plus, experience has shown my marketing skills lack much
effect. However, this does not mean that development work is completely
over. I would like to upgrade the game to the most recent version of the
toolkit (Unity 5.6), and create a non-Steam-DRM version for Humble and
Itch.io.</p>

<p>The immediate plan is to leave CI alone while I get a good base of work
completed on other projects. Then start a 1.2 update with either a
non-DRM or Unity 5.6 version as the main task, plus other minor items
and bugfixes making up at least 3 weeks duration (not counting testing),
aiming for release in March or April. Then the game will be left alone
again for a few months before beginning a final 1.3 update in the second
half of the year. This will contain all the remaining tasks that must be
completed, because after this it will just be bugfixes. Hopefully it
will be only on the order of 3 weeks dev work.</p>

<p><strong>A Gamedev Plays…</strong></p>

<p>As Concealed Intent approached release I started playing other games
again. For the previous four years of development there was very little
time for non-work activities and my game backlog began to grow. I
decided to play more games to become aware of the state of modern game
design. To help I started the <em>A Gamedev Plays …</em>
<a href="http://www.agamedevplays.com">website/blog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a>.
Despite plans to work intensively on a new game, I hope to continue
playing games and publishing my thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>Blockade Runner</strong></p>

<p><a href="/2016/11/23/Dev-Update">As previously stated</a>, work has begun on my
next game, codenamed <em>Blockade Runner</em>. One of my first tasks is to
think of a better name! Progress has been very slow as other tasks and
holidays have taken precedence. Now I need to just buckle down and get
to work. I’m happy with the basic idea and confident it can work, but
really need a gameplay prototype to test out my assumptions. Especially
since I hope to be largely finished with the basics within the next few
months and then just polish it. Also I need to get a proper name and
start the marketing process. I plan on being more open to the community
while working on this game. This will mainly come in the form of more
regular updates and perhaps even video dev diaries.</p>

<p><strong>Routine</strong></p>

<p>Writing it all down, it looks like I am committing myself to an
overwhelming (and unlikely) workload. I think holding to the plans
outlined above is possible, but will require some discipline and luck.
It is very possible some tasks will slip. The main problem on the
horizon is moving countries scheduled for May. I will be leaving
Malaysia and going somewhere else, as yet undecided. This may steal a
great deal of my time. I hope to build a routine (at least until moving)
to try and help achieve as much as possible - previously I have worked
well under such circumstances. It will be a 1/4/2 system. Monday will be
for admin, blogging, marketing and A Gamedev Plays. Tuesday through to
Friday will be dev work as much as possible. Saturday and Sunday will
have less time available on Jarrah Technology as it will mainly be spent
with my girlfriend, exercising, or getting things done around the house.
The idea is that this will allow me to effectively focus on a single set
of tasks each day, rather than jumping around like when developing
Concealed Intent.</p>

<p>So that is the plan, now to implement it!</p>
