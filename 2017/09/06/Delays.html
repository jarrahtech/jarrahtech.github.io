      <p>Delays, delays, delays. It has been three months since my last posting,
and five months since I did any work on Concealed Intent (with the 1.2
release). Since then I have moved continent and started a very busy day
job at a London startup.</p>

<p>I have also previously said there will be a 1.3 release by the end of
the year. Given current events, how is that going? It is still possible,
but only if I start work soon. This weekend I downloaded the most recent
version of Unity3D. Hopefully by now they have fixed most of the bugs.
If I can start finding time to make some progress over the next couple
of weekends then a 1.3 release by December is achievable.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/374150/discussions/">Steam
Forums</a> about what
the next version should contain. It seems the most regular players want
the ability to replay entire games after they are complete. So that will
be the main focus of the update. I will publish a list of goals for the
update once work has started and I have an idea of how much can be done.
If there is something you particularly want, speak now, because 1.3 will
probably be the last notable update for the game.</p>

<p>Sales of Concealed Intent have continued at a steady, but slow, pace
since the last financial posting. Below is the update sales vs costs
graph. There is a nice little bump every time a Steam Sale comes around,
but in-between only a handful of copies are sold. I have covered my
costs now, but nowhere close to being able to live on the profits and
develop a second game full-time (at least while living in London). Thus
the time consuming day job.</p>

<p>Finally, for those with long memories, it was promised that Concealed
Intent would not bundled until at least the 3rd August 2017 (a full year
after release). Well that date has passed and the game has not yet been
bundled. I have not been contacted by bundlers since that date, but also
I’m not keen to bundle anyway. Looking at expected bundle sales, it
would not make much difference to the graph above. Also now I have a
job, I do not need the small amount of money bundling would bring. So,
while I am not renewing the non-bundling pledge (because if Humble
Bundle come knocking, I’m answering!), it is also probably unlikely that
Concealed Intent will be bundled in the near future.</p>
