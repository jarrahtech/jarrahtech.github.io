      <p>When I talk to people about Concealed Intent, one of the most common
responses is “Are you going to do a
”KickStarter“:http://www.kickstarter.com/?”. The answer is “no, or at
least not for a while”.</p>

<p>KickStarter is a great idea and has received a great deal of press in
gaming circles recently. It allows developers to basically presell their
game (or other project - it is not just games) and get the money in
advance of actually finishing. The benefit for the backers is the warm
fuzzy feeling of supporting Indie games and usually a copy of the game,
sometimes with extra paraphernalia (posters, t-shirts, etc). There are
concerns too, some people point out there is no guarantee any backed
project will deliver - the money could disappear. Despite this
KickStarter has hundreds of games raising money right now. <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/kickstarter-katchup/">Rock, Paper,
Shotgun</a> even
do a regular roundup of projects. There have been some huge success:
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/66710809/double-fine-adventure">Double
Fine</a>
raised over $3 million; <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">Wasteland
2</a> raised just
under $3 million (and it will be written using Unity3D); and as I write
this <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">Project
Eternity</a>
(to which I have contributed) has raised over $1 million in 24 hours
with 31 more days to go.</p>

<p>So why wouldn’t I jump on the bandwagon? Basically because I don’t need
the money right now and it would be a distraction. The successful
KickStarters put in a great deal of effort to impress potential backers
and raise awareness. I have no significant history or background in the
gaming industry and Concealed Intent is at a very early stage of
development. Time is better spent improving the game than creating
videos to sell it. Luckily, Jarrah Technology was a consulting company
in a previous incarnation and retained profits can fund development for
some time (especially considering my very low expenses!).</p>

<p>As Concealed Intent approaches completion the situation may change.
Artwork and music will need to be acquired externally. The quality and
quantity of this media will be driven directly by how much I’m prepared
to pay. A little extra money at this stage could go a long way. A
KickStarter then may be beneficial. I could use the near-completed game
as evidence it will be completed and the backers will receive their
rewards. It could also be good PR - letting people know the graphics
will be professionally produced. However, that is at least over a year
away, so don’t look for Concealed Intent on KickStarter anytime soon.</p>
